"I am from Pune, born and brought in Pune, I m a commerce graduate &amp; I have completed my graduation through Pune University. I m very ambitious and having positive attitude towards life. As per my thinking marriage means It is said that marriages are made in heaven and celebrated on earth. The popular belief is true to many extent, because it is a special bond shared between two souls, who tie the wedding knot after promising to be companions for a lifetime. It is the physical, mental and spiritual unison of two souls. It brings significant stability and substance to human relationships, which is otherwise incomplete. It plays a crucial role in transferring the culture and civilization from one generation to the other, so that the human race is prospered. Marriage is life long commitment so i m looking for like-minded life partner,  someone who appreciates arts and culture including Indian music and dance. Also,someone who enjoys adventure,nature,change,willingness to travel and share experiences.

"AA?A?Beauty without grace is the hook without the baitAA?A?, this is a well-said thought by Ralph Waldo Emerson. Beauty does not depend on the number of times you visit the parlor. It totally depends on the way of carrying yourself. If you have grace in your body then you are the most beautiful person on earth.
I consider myself beautiful because I feel it from inside. I try to remain as graceful as I can and this makes me feel I look good. The other reason why I feel I am beautiful is my heart. I am a very clean-hearted person and I am sure that even if I have wrinkles on my face one day I will still feel I the same as my heart will remain the same. 
I am an IT Professional but I am not working at the moment because of some reason. I am sure when I start working I will acquire what I have set as my goal. 
My father is an Executive Engineer and he has always been my inspiration. I feel that whatever I am today is because of my parents. Other than that, I have loads of friends and I like all of them. I trust them completely and most of the times when I am free I hang around with them. 
My favorite holiday destination is Goa. The reason why I love that place is that I am admired with its beauty. Every element of that place is fascinating to me. Long drives by motor bikes, sea, free attitude of people etc.","Every woman wants to marry a man who is both liberal and protective. I want the same combination for myself too. I want him to trust me with things and not doubt me, and on the other hand, I want him to be very protective about me and feel what is my problem is his too. He needs to know that I am very career oriented and want to be well settled. I want myself to be known because of me and not because of him. He must understand that and should keep away from my decisions that are related to my career. His suggestions are always welcome but I will not accept any sort of pressure from his side. He can feel free to tell me if he finds something unsuitable in me, but he should not keep that to himself. This will create differences between us. Having a healthy relationship all my life is something that I would prefer to over anything else. I will prefer a man who is very smart so that we can both make a wonderful couple. I don't want him to be extraordinarily good looking but he should be pleasant looking. However, his personality is what is important and that should be very interesting. With all these qualities in a man, I will promise to keep him happy forever. All I need from him is a great deal of support and love.",,30 to 32,27 Aug 1981,03:55:00,India,Kanpur,Slim,Athletic,,Agarwal,Agarwal,,,Very Fair ,Fair,Daughter,BE B.Tech (Engineering),"32 yrs, 5ft 6in,<br />

"Hi!

I come from a south Indian family, born &amp; raised in Bangalore. I love nature, music and chess.
I am jovial and easy going type - fun to be with, also energetic and of course good looking &amp; full of life. I look for happiness in simple things and live each day in the most optimistic way.

Spirituality interests me a lot and strongly believe in God, yet am broad minded in my approach towards life. I have a blend of both traditional Indian values and western ethics. 

My type of ideal life partner is someone who is nice, simple, well read, caring and compassionate, one who's inclined to family and friends and is an optimist.

If you marry the wrong person, no amount of effort on your part can fix it, and no number of good circumstances can make it bearable. This was true in my life too. 

Unfortunately, I had been a victim to this circumstance. But life has to move on for me. I have accepted the reality as some bad moments of my life and looking forward for a good companion who believes in being friendly and caring towards relationship. 

I guess the point is, you have to marry the right person, and the circumstances don't honestly matter that much. Marriage is a life time commitment and experience, it is not an experiment.

All the best in your partner search.",,,30 to 38,09 Jul 1981,02:45:00,India,Bangalore,Average,,1 brother ,Vishwakarma,,Bangalore,Karanataka University,Fair ,,Self,BBA/BBM/BBS,"32 yrs, 5ft,<br />

"I introduce myself as a sweet and humble person as I like to be this way. It helps me to maintain cordial relations with everyone. Due to my humble and sweet nature I have gained a lot of applause from my near ones.  I am a very intelligent person who lives life strategically and has a positive outlook towards life. 
I am a very flexible person who works with great determination. I am from a field which requires a lot of strength. In my professional life I am working as a Major in the Indian Army. In future I would like to continue my profession in the same sector and grow as much as I can. 
My mother is a homemaker and father is a director of ordinance factory. I have a brother who is working with a pharmaceutical company as a Scientist in Singapore and sister who is married and presently pursuing PhD from New Zeeland. 
I was a bright student in my school and received immense appreciation from my teachers. Further, I was the topper in all disciplines at my education level. After school education I completed my B Sc and M Sc Nursing from AFMC Pune. 
Music is something that brings liveliness in me and I enjoy it a lot. I also like to watch movies and travel to new destinations in my free time.","Marriage is turning point of life between two individuals which demands a lot of mutual respect, trust and understanding. I completely believe in this phrase and want a man who can understand me well.  
Being a sweet and humble person I would marry a person who is like me. He should understand enough so that he understands my job profile of Army life. Further, he should also know that my profession is very dynamic and I can be transferred to any city after few years. Therefore, I want him to be aware of this fact and to be okay with it. If this suits him then I can further go ahead in getting married to that person. This is my major concern. 
He can pose any profession of his choice and I have no problem with it. I want my life partner to be well educated and qualified so that we mingle with each other easily. He must come from a decent family background and they should have a good image in the society. This is an important factor as it will make easy for me and my family to trust them.

"Thank you for reading my profile. 
Education-wise, I am a BSc medical graduate and presently employed as a Student Visa Consultant in an immigration consultant company. Having worked for over 6 years in various multinational companies, I now want to settle down in marriage with a compatable person. I am also willing to relocate with the committed person and together explore, understand and share life's different phases.
Being a very exuberant and lively person, I love travelling and making new friends and acquaintances. My attitude toward life and work is very positive and I believe in living life to the fullest. Along with interest in music and yoga, I also help in household activities like cooking, decorating and cleaning.
Whenever I am free I am generally with my friends, sometimes on an excursion or a walk in the hills or shopping or watching a movie or listening to music. Though I love freedom, at the same time I respect my elders and value my Indian culture. 
I strongly believe that relationships are not meant to be analysed but lived to the fullest. I think if we go around judging each otherA?A?A?AA?A?A?AA?A??A?A?A?AA?A?A?AA?A??A?A?A?As worth then there would not be enough time to understand and love each other. Since it takes two to tango, therefore, both need to adjust to make the relationship work. Also, ego should have no place in a love relationship as I feel it is not possible to love someone unless you are selfless.
There are other qualities that shape me, some may be good and some bad (though not repulsive), but that is best left to be discovered later.

She is keen in pursuing her career in the field of eduation after marriage. Education: - I have done M. A English, B. A English Hons from Delhi Univ and B. Ed from IP univ(all regular). After doing B. ed I have gained work experience as TGT English for two years. My last appointment was with Bal Bharati Public School, New Delhi in mid 2008. After that, as I aim to become a lecturer I have submitted my Phd and am looking for a job. Now I take over from my lovely elder brother and scribble something about me, as she insisted me to do so. Well what can I say about myself, to start with, I am inculcated with profound values by my parents whom I love very much, they have been there for me through both thick and thin, and I am grateful that they have brought up both their children with grounded values, that make us look different from the mass at large, by the way in a good way I mean :)). In addition, to this I truly believe that one should always be ready for changes in life as nothing is static so why should we be, transform accordingly and move ahead. According to me, for a great marriage love, trust and compatibility is a must, without either one of them the feeling of fulfillment is never reached. I believe that marriage is no is not only a union of two souls but a union of two families as well, and will always consider the family in which I go as mine, and would need their support to help me become a part of them, and for my in laws to consider me as their daughter, but in return I would love that my husband would truly become a part of my family and consider it as his and my parents as his,and my parents as his, in a true sense I mean. Apart from the above mentioned side of me I am chirpy

"I represent myself as a simple and soft spoken person who is friendly in nature. I am an understanding person with high family values. My personality is a blend of modern and high traditional values that really sets me apart from others. 
I am a hard working person and I am completely devoted towards my work. I do my work with full concentration and dedication and never give a chance to anyone to take out any mistake in my work. Presently I am working as a media professional and I am very happy with my professional life. In the upcoming time I would like to pursue my career in the same field and attain a reputed position in life. 
My only major weakness is that I am very emotional in nature due to which many people take advantage of it. The ones who know me well never make fun of me and make me strong in order to face this world with more confidence. 
My mother is a housewife and father is a retired Chief Engineer of the UP Irrigation Department. I have a sister who is married and my brother-in-law is a Post Doc Research by profession in Delft University. 
In the higher education sector I have completed MBA from Devi Ahillya University Indore and BA from Lucknow University. 
I have very few friends in my life and I like to be with them. Whenever I get time from my work I spend my time listening to music, singing and travelling to new places. I love pets and also like to write.","I am looking for a caring man to enter my life who can understand me and my aspirations in life. He should be a well educated and responsible man. It would be great if he loves pets and likes traveling to interesting destinations. This way both of us will share common hobbies and will spend good time together. 
I want my life partner to respect my views and feelings. In return he will seek a lot of love and respect from my side. Personally I would prefer a man from Lucknow, Delhi or Mumbai. He should have a positive outlook towards life and must have a broader aspect of judging things in life.  
I want my life partner to be from the same profession in which I am so that both of us can understand the work pressure and commitments. He should be from a good family background and must be well settled in his life. His family must have a decent image in the society. I am ready to spend my entire life with him if he is like the one I have always desired for.

"A religious person always feels connected to God. He gets to talk or converse with him whenever he wants to. I know this because I am very religious and know what it feels like when you believe a lot in him. 
I have always been like this. My parents taught me the importance of believing in God and worshipping him as well as thanking him for all that he has given us. That is when I realized how happy I feel after praying. Therefore, I have always been praying to God and will keep doing this till I am alive. 
I am a Software Professional in Infosys. I like my work and enjoy doing it. I want to excel in the same field in future. I am sure I will be able to do it as I am very dedicated towards my work. 
My school education was very smooth. After schooling, I completed B tech from UPTU, and did diploma from CDAC in Pune. I always paid attention in class and towards my teachers and that is how I am aware of things. 
My father is a senior Manager and my mother is a homemaker. My brother is pursuing M.COM. Apart from that, I have many friends. My family and friends are very important for me. I can do anything for them and I am sure if I need them someday, they will be there for me. 
When I am free, I like listening to music and reading book. I also like to watch movies.","I want my partner to be either a business man or a Software Professional. This is because I find business men very charming and interesting. Being an owner is always a very fascinating thing and I like people who have the power to own things. 
If he is a Software Professional then it will be a good thing, as we will have a very important thing in common, and will also be able to interact as well as discuss many things related to it. It will be easier for us to understand each otherAA?A?s work and also to sort out issues whenever we face any problems at work. 
He should be from a very good family. This is because when two people get married they not only get to live with each other but also with their families. I can adjust with his family only when his family accepts me as I am and loves me. 
He should be a very pure person. He should be a non-smoker and should not consume alcohol. The reason why I hate all this is because they create a lot of nuisance and people who consume all this are least concerned about their health. 
He should be very helpful, not only emotionally, but should also assist me in household work. I know Indian men consider it as a disgrace but I donAA?A?t want my partner to be like this. He should also be concerned about the family and not leave all the responsibility on my shoulders. 
I am sure if he is what I expect him to be, I will give him all that he needs from his wife. ",,30 to 34,29 May 1981,15:45:00,India,Pilibhit,Average,Average,,Khatri,Khatri,,,Wheatish ,Wheatish,Daughter,BE B.Tech (Engineering),"32 yrs, 5ft 4in,<br />

I am a Simple yet Modern girl working as an Assistant Professor in an engineering college. Looking for a compatible match. Caste no Bar.,"In my view, three characteristics are essential for a marriage partner. First and foremost, compatibility is very important because spending time for the rest of your life with someone is a huge commitment and without compatibility in values, interests and goals, it would be a struggle rather than a partnership.

Besides, maturity is also an important factor for being a good partner. I don't want to hang out with someone who is childish and cannot take care of one's self. At my age, it's time to consider a long-term relationship, which requires not only love and affection but also responsibility and care.

Moreover, a partner should be open-minded. Being a couple doesn't mean that we have to agree in everything. Relationship should be based on open mind to accept and give honor to each others' idea although it is different from yours.",,,05 Jan 1981,10:15:00,India,Ambala,Slim,,,Agarwal,,,,Wheatish ,,Daughter,M.Tech,"32 yrs, 5ft 2in,<br />

"I grew up in a family with lots of love in an environment that encouraged intellectual growth and a happy-go-lucky attitude. Most weekends of my childhood were spent traveling, camping and going on adventurous journeys with family, while at the same time being taught the importance of education and being sent to good schools. There was never any pressure to top at school, and all that has been expected of me and my brother is that we are better human beings than good professionals. I inherit this happy-go-lucky, adventurous, free-spirited attitude from my parents, while being a good human being who respects our traditions and values. I have traveled to Africa, Australia, some parts of Europe and Asia keeping up with the family tradition!! People who know me see me as a strange but interesting mix of a traditionalist with modern ideas, a conformist with a liking for anything anti-establishment, and a push-over with a mind of her own. Other than this, I have a deep love for music and intellectual conversations, and feel a special bond with people who have a flair for either. But, when it comes to my life partner, all I wish for is a person who I feel a connect with. I have completed my Masters in Social Work from Hyderabad with a gold medal, and have almost completed my MS in Research Methods from the University of Bristol, after having worked for 6 years in the NGO sector.","Looking for a someone with whom a lazy, Sunday evening chat would be as exciting as an adrenaline-filled field day on a trek, someone who is well-read, and derives pleasure from the simple things in life; and of course, someone who has a good sense of humour.","I belong to an educated, intellectual family comprising of my grandmother, mother, elder brother and myself.

Further, he should be well educated and must have a positive outlook towards life. He must look at life broadly and have a broader aspect of judging life. Further, he must come from a decent family background and they must be known in the society for their good deeds. My parents want me to get settled in a well mannered and civilized family. Therefore, the family of my life partner must be well mannered so that even my parents are relieved about my happy future.

"Hi and welcome to my profile!! Describing myself is the hardest part in this entire process, but here goes.

Honest, jovial and friendly is what I believe I am. 

Family&Friends; says that I look like ""Shiva Balaji (Arya, Chandamama fame)

My family currently resides in Wanaparthy (Mahaboob Nagar District) and I am currently living in Hyderabad. I am a Software Professional working for a Private firm. 

My friends would describe me as an outgoing, confident, trustworthy, jovial and friendly an overall happy person. I like to do a multitude of things to keep myself busy (other than office work =P). I love to listen music when I have time, I like to go out and have fun; movies, bowling, tracking are some of the things I like to do with friends. There are not many things that I dislike, I am generally a go with the flow type of person as long as fun is part of the equation.  

The kind of person I am looking for should be family-oriented, humble, sincere, and open to new ideas. Someone I can connect with religiously/spiritually.  

I also believe that the best and most successful relationships are based on the foundation of friendship. So, get to know me.

This is to get started... more if the interest is mutual

"Enjoying life is a very important aspect. Being happy makes people very lovable. It makes them very attractive and people want to hang out with them always. Not because they are cool but because in todayAA?A?s scenario anyone can make people sad but very few can make them happy. 
I am one of those people who believe in being and making people happy. People who know me appreciate my nature. I not only make myself but others also happy. This according to me is the reason why I am self made and so successful. 
I am a Senior Process Associate in an MNC. I like my job and find it very interesting. I wish to work in the same field in future too and have success in it. I am sure I will be able to achieve whatever I want to as I am very hard working and dedicated as far as my work is concerned. 
After schooling, I did graduation in B Com from Allahabad University. Then I did post graduation in MBA from NIMT.  I have always been a very sincere student and I wish to remain the same as a person too. 
My father is an Advocate in high court and my brother is working in Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation. His wife is a homemaker. I have every one but my family became incomplete when I lost my mother. She was an integral part of our life and we miss her now. 
In leisure time, I like listening to music and watch movies. I like going on long drives and I also like travelling.","As I mentioned above, I am very fun loving and jovial. Therefore, I would like my partner to be the same. I am aware of the fact that people who are like each other tend to get along well. I am sure we will gel up well if he is fun loving and jovial. 
I am very open to all the cultures and have no problems if he is modern or traditional. The only thing that will matter is his educational background. He has to be in a good profession, as I will appreciate that a lot. 
Being a woman, I want my partner to be very protective and loving. This will make him very important for me and will give him a very respectable place in my mind. Apart from that, I donAA?A?t want him to be a sadist and he should be very cheerful and jovial. 
The man I get married to must not have any bad habits. This can affect our married life and can cause many problems in future. He can be from any profession, as I donAA?A?t have any reservations about that as long as he is in a respectable position and in a recognized company. 
We will make our married life memorable not only for each other but also for the people who know us. The only thing I want from him is his love and support.

"Our personality is the result of what we think in life. I describe myself as a fun loving and jolly natured person who loves to spread happiness all around. Apart from this, I am a very soft spoken person which is the best trait of my personality. 
I know the importance of family values and take utmost care of it. I have a modern lifestyle but at the same time I respect our traditional and cultural values and follow them.    
I give my best in my work and it gives me immense pleasure. In my professional life I am very serious, loyal and dedicated towards my work. It motivates me to work hard every day so that I reach the heights of success. Currently I am working as an HR professional in the MNC and I am very happy with my profession. In future I would like to continue in the same field. 
I am very close to my family and grateful to my parents for giving me such wonderful life with all the facilities and good environment. My mother is a homemaker and father is a retired government employee. I have a sister who is happily married and well settled. 
My school education was smooth and I was a good student of my class. After completing my school education I did my graduation from Ajmer University, Bikaner and MBA from Rajasthan University. 
I am very creative and always look out for something new to create and discover. The list of my hobbies comprises of travelling to new destinations, listening to music, diving, and watching movies. 
Whenever I get time after my work I like to spend the time with my friends. I restrict myself to my very few friends as I donAA?A?t like to share my thoughts with everyone.","Life is very precious and does not come back once it is gone so therefore the decisions must me made carefully. Marriage is one the most important decisions of life as it binds two different individuals together in pure relation. After all, it is a life time relation so one must make the choice on her/his own.
I want a life partner who is simple and decent so that both of us can share a good bond together. He must understand as it will assist us in leading a good life without hassles. I would personally prefer a man from Rajasthan, Delhi/NCR. 
I have no issues in spending rest of my life with a person from any profession. He must understand and respect my profession and should not have any problem if I continue working. This way he will gain his respect in my eyes.
He should be well educated and qualified so that he has a broader aspect of living and judging the life. His should belong to a good background and his family must have a decent image in the society. My major weakness is that I am a straight forward person and donAA?A?t keep the things in my heart. I want my life partner to know about it and expect him to understand the positive side of it. Once he gets to know me precisely then he will be proud of this fact. I strongly believe in commitments and this what I am looking for.

"God is the one who handles and takes care of the whole world. 
ItAa?a?s an invisible power that operates the whole world efficiently and skillfully. I am God a fearing girl and believe that whatever happens, happens for good.  Only He gives the best awards, rewards or punishments to His creation.
I am the youngest daughter of my parents, and belong to a decent and well respected family. All my brothers and sisters look after me so well that I never felt any problem coming near to me. I am very homely girl and like to spend time with my family, that's why I did not choose any profession. 
I like cooking and love to cook for family and loved ones. 
I feel that being a good cook is like a gift to me. I feel this is the best asset I have. Apart from that, I am very simple, down to the earth and possess a cheerful personality. A very innocent, cute and charming heart lies in me and I cannot tolerate harsh and strict words. 
 I like to explore and visit new places. My desirable travel destinations are hill stations. I live life happily and follow modern ideas for living my lifestyle.","I am the youngest member of my family, they have given me lots of love and care, and I have given respect and acceptance to their suggestions and decisions for me. Its not a give and take relation; its a relation of heart and soul. 
Now I really want to append a new relation of my own choice; my life partner. I will make a relation of heart and soul, a relation of love and support, a relation of suggestions and decisions.
 I am looking for a person who is strong and responsible, cheerful and sensible too. He must belong to a good family background and can become a good and honest husband.
His looks do not matter much to me but my family will search a good-looking, smart and handsome guy with an average height.
I am living in a joint family and I know my responsibilities. I will fulfill all my responsibilities whole-heartedly. As I am able to understand the mindsets of different age and personality, it will not be tough for me to manage in any family either that will be nuclear or joint. However, I will prefer joint family same as my brothers. 
I believe his family will never let me alone and from my end, I will give my best to make them all happy.

After a hard day's work, I like to relax with a book or a movie. I'm not a very gregarious person and I have a total of 1 close friend. But I can get along with most people. I love eating and keep trying out new salads at home. I would like to travel but I haven't gotten around to doing that too much.  
I guess I do all the regular things the way everyone does them, but at the end of the day, I think I know what I want to do. I don't mean to sound like some geek who's got everything figured out or some weirdo who thinks the aliens are coming! I believe that above and beyond the mind and body culture, there is a soul culture that I need to focus on. In fact that's first on my to-do list.  I'm a compassionate person and I have a very low pain threshold when it comes to others - a wounded dog or a field of wilting crops can make me very sad.

"Hi there!! Thanks, for taking the time to view her profile. 

She was born in Mumbai and raised partly in Mumbai and part in Ahmedabad. She has been working in the insurance sector in sales. Has also done her diploma in Management Studies. 

Personality wise she is less talkative or one would describe her as a good and patient listener. Is a complete movie buff, likes spending time with friends, listening to music. But above all reading takes the top spot on her list. She is a fun loving, easy going person and always maintains an optimistic attitude to life. She tends to have an affinity towards the finer things in life. 
Is career minded, but at the same time she never lets it over ride her personal life. 

Well that more or less sums it up. Thanks for being patient enough to read her profile. 

Good luck in your search.","In terms of partner expectations, I guess she is looking for a soul mate of sorts. A guy who can be her friend and a partner in every sense and with whom she can share her life with. Someone who is easy to get along with and who would be there with her thru the highs and lows. He should be confident, good natured, fun loving and loyal. Above all he shoud be a warm and caring person. Love for movies would be an added advantage!!!
