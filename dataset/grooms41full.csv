"I describe myself as a simple person and I like to live life in a simple way. Further, I am a family oriented person and like to spend time with my family members. My family is my strength and they always encourage me to move ahead in life. 
In my professional life I am very serious and do my work with complete dedication and loyalty. By profession I am a business man. In future I want to attain a reputed position and expand my business to great heights. 
My main weakness is that I am a very emotional person. Due to my emotional nature many people make fun of me and even take advantage of this. The ones who know me well make sure that they dona??t make fun of me neither do they take advantage of my emotional nature.
My mother is a homemaker and father is no more in our life. I have two sisters who are happily married and well settled in their life. Further, I have a brother who is married and well settled in his life.
In my education sector I have completed intermediate.
I have few friends in my life and I like to spend most of my time with them. In my free time I like to listen to music and watch TV. I also like to travel to new places and explore the beauty of each place.","I am looking for a simple female to enter my life, just like me, so that we can share a good bond. She should be a family oriented person and should like to spend time with family members. She should respect me and my family members.
My life partner should have a positive outlook towards life and must judge everything with a broader aspect. She should be well educated and must come from a good family background. She should mingle with my family and must accept them.
I have no issues if my life partner wants to work in future or wants to be a homemaker. I will be there to support her in the decision she takes related to her career. Personally I would prefer a female from Maharashtra.
I am ready to give all my love to her if she is like the one I have always desired for.

"Self-dependent, self-brought person being raised by mother and my elder brother who expired in June 2007 in a road accident. Am convent educated but had to drop out in BSc Finaly year because of family situation and came in to field. Have worked in Pharmaceutical in marketing and in office and then switched over to Medical Transcriptionst profession where have got around 10 years of experience.  Have a small family, myself and my mother.

Family wise, as such, what to say, we have/had a very, very big family 6 sisters and one brother from mother's side and 6 brothers from father's side.  But unfortunately due to early demise of father, and nobody came forward to help, myself and my brother were single handedly brought up by my mother and there had never been any contact with any of the so called big family anytime in my life.

hence we had a quite tough time but yet we were convent educated and hence our future was well secured in that sense.  curtsey, mother's hard work and approach to life.  

We had our hair cut after the 84 episode.

then my brother started his career with pharma and things changed for better and then we shifted to lucknow.  he got married in 94. but here again the better half of my brother turned out to be not a made for each other type of match.  yet they carried on with life after an initial 1-1/2 year separation.  they had one son earlier and then one son after their reunion.  but unfortunately on june 11 2007 my brother expired in a road accident and because of earlief issues and after his death coupled with the fact that huge money came in from insurance and other sources, she went her way and now we really do not have any link with them.

So, as on date, on the family front, it is me and my mother only.

profession wise, I also started working quite early in my life with teaching and then in pharma.  have worked in different profiles, as a office assistant to office manager, then medical representative, then area manager and then came in to this medical transcription profession.  right now am working from home only and my working hours are around 9-11 hours on average and income ranges from 25 to 35,000.

I also own a small house, 4 marla, 100 gajj.  this house was purchased just 2 months before brother's death and we had planned, because we had very good understanding, something else and hence we had the both name on the property, and hence it was a small worry for me but when I looked all options legal and otherwise there was nothign to worry for me. because we had the majority amount in loan and am handling that.  on the property of 15.5 lacs we had taken loan of 12.80 lacs from loan and in legal terms they cannot claim and as such what they can claim is only till the time of his death which had calculated comes to 1 lac only and that too i am to give to someone on their side which i have asked to get the matter sorted and take the money or else forget it.  as such, mother is staying with me and her share a big one, but we never ever had such intention when he was alive, so we never ever thought of going on that lines.

This was in nutshell.","Any religion/caste but she must be presentable, homely person who is caring and loving and understands the values of life and respects the ethos of life with all the life brings to individual.  High educational qualifation is not a requirement.  Sound financial background is also not a required.   Am totally against given and take style of marriage please.

I may sound Cliche' when I say that I want a Tall (above 5'7 in height) &amp;  Fair (Very Fair if Possible) and Well Built woman as my wife. But this is the basic need for most of us Indian men &amp;  certainly Iam no exception.

I do not mind if she is of ANY CASTE OR EVEN RELIGION (I'd prefer her to be from Indian religions like Sikhism, Buddhism, Jainism, Hinduism or any other form of worship originating in our Motherland India) and of ANY LANGUAGE, provided she is of the looks mentioned above.

Also I do not mind if she is a WIDOW or a DIVORCEE as well; with or without kids.

Besides this, I'd like her to be of an understanding nature and fun loving and kind not only to me but to everyone in general.

Hmmm...it will be nice if she is Media Savvy, because, I wanted to start a program called STREE SURAKSHA ABHYAAN - to strengthen Indian women both physically &amp;  Spiritually. But sadly my being a man is a handicap...but with the advent of my wife in my life..this project can succeed. My wife too shall benifit immensely. She will become RICH, FAMOUS &amp;  POWERFUL.

Please do ask me any details you need,

Keep Smiling &amp;  may the Lord grant you your choiciest wishes...

"Myself and present status: 
I am Samir, 36-year-age Bengali in search out for a perfect soul mate. I am basically sensitive, very emotional, honest, and helpful. I like to lead a simple life. I am liberal and don't believe in casts. 
I did B.E.in civil engineering from REC-NIT Silchar &amp; presently working in an Italy based Consultant Company MNC-as a consultant Engineers with post of Asst. Resident Engineer in its Doha branch, capital city of Qatar. My present monthly salary 1.25 lacs    free telephone calls   car   yearly one month paid vacation with air ticket   medical   gratuity   other perks. I have 8 hrs. duty a day; a total of 48 hrs. max in a week. My holydays includes Friday as normal plus all govt. and public holydays. Iam staying Doha as residential Visa status. Doha is the capital city of State of Qatar. It
's a nice beautiful modern city in the coast of Arabian Sea; about 6 hrs. air journey from Dum Dum. Though Qatar is a Muslim country but everybody is free about their cultural liberalization, about 1.2 million citizen called Qatari among other 8 lakh foreign expatriates, including Indian and other asians Americans, British, French, Italian are among the others. Doha, the heart of Qatar,  is an absolute cultural melt pot. The stunning newly built high rise buildings and towers on sea coast carries the glamour and proud of the city.
I had my legalized issueless mutual separation in 2005. And since then I am absolutely alone and leading a complete simple bachelor life. I have a lovely 8-years-old son, Subhra, studying std.III staying in hostel in Barasat under my parents' supervision backed by my sister at my native home town Thakurnagar, North 24 pgs.  
A generous family support &amp; love helped me to overcome myself from that crisis period and resumed to have a normal life. Principally I was decided not to marry again but my parents insisted me every time to do so and I have realized the importance and the value of a partner who will be by my side for the rest of my life. I do strongly believe in the capabilities of women to make things more organized and redirect into proper destinations. I respect women.
One innocent child deserted abundantly from its most deserved maternal love. And I have to be ready to answer. I need somebody's help who can able to play a role heartedly and understand above all. Of course I will marry for myself not for the child &amp; she will stay with me in abroad far away from my son but responsibilities must be laid in her mind. 
About my family background:
 I have been brought up with a traditional lower middle class joint family which comprises my parents, my elder brother and my younger sister who are both married. My brother is separated having one son and a daughter both are studying. My sister is working who has one daughter. My father was a small business man who was just able to manage to bring up us and who gave us foundation of honesty, family values, ethics and respect to my elders. Presently he is taking care of our few land properties; just he is passing his time. My mother is very emotional and a devoted house wife, she likes to cook and worship. Normally we are atheist and we are quite happy by the grass of God. Precisely I have my own new house and few land properties which is quite productive. But we are not rich, same way we are not poor also.

My instinct hobbies:
My hobbies include working with computers, surfing the net, reading news papers and listening music. I like to read and know current affairs happening around the world. I am simply a fond fan of cricket and football of any kind. I smoke moderately with branded cigarette, although I hate smoking which I quit several times.  I can't drink at all.
Future plans and ambitions:
To be married April or May 2009 and I will be happiest if she doesn't carry anything from her parents'. I hate dowry. To be built or buy another house and then settle in city either Kolkata or Mumbai/New Delhi,","About my ideal partner: 
My ideal partner should be very simple &amp;   honest. She has to be quite intelligent, smart and a bit of good sense of humor. She should be able to understand her life partner and to be her best friend. 
The most importantly she must be mother of my son in all the way to fill gaps created already and able to manage the things ahead.  I have faith that only a lady can do it perfectly. I believe a women's greatest achievement remain its maternity. In one hand she has to be lover for her husband, one the other hand she has be a mother for her children. It's not easy but a woman can do that and that is why they are the most powerful creature in the world. We should show respect to elder esp. parents and other family members irrespective of their age because I do believe every member of a family having some importance and play a significant role to live happily. 
She must be agreed to stay with me in abroad and capable to negotiate the situations. I have almost everything except? ?? which I deserve most.

I am graduated from Madras University &amp; did my MBA(Personnel) from Lucknow university. 

In my family includes my parents ; dad a retd IAF Officer &amp; mom a housewife ; three siblings -sisters, all married &amp; leading a happy life.
 
At present , I am working in a reputed MNC in Noida as a social accountability manager. 

At the same time , I have recently started my own business in the retail field &amp; working with some reputed international clients based in US &amp; UK as a business consultant.

Hi! A little about myself well .I'm a very passionate person who lives life to the fullest. I believe each day is a gift, therefore, I concentrate on the positive aspects of my life and being happy. Life is way too short to waste being consumed by negativity. I'm VERY fun, spontaneous and dreamy. There is nothing better than getting 'lost in the moment' after all isn't that what life is all about? I love exploring new thoughts and ideas. I enjoy stimulating conversation. It's incredible when you are so in tune with someone you can talk for hours without even realizing time has gone by.I give 100 in relationships. I am not afraid to share my feelings and do not hold back emotionally.

I love to laugh a lot and I would love to meet someone who can make me do that, someone I can make laugh and enjoy beautiful moments with me and enjoy my sense of humour too. I am a giving person, ready to help in any way as well, take that how you want but I am just looking to be on a similar level with someone, so that together we can make the most of life and compliment each other.

I have completed my post graduation diploma in Financial management and my Masters in Commerce (From Jabalpur University, M. P. ) &amp; currently working with HDFC as a Manager-Sales (in Mumbai) since last 3.5 years
Individual confidence, empathy, patience and respect for elders are the qualities that attract me in a girl. Personally i have a good sense of humor, a flair for writing and love for traveling.
I certainly believe in giving my partner the space IF SHE NEEDS TO UTILIZE HER TALENT.However, I do think that she should be in a position to balance the responsibilities at home too. I must also share with you that i am quite capable of shouldering an equal amount of responsibility of taking care of our home and family.
My parents are extremely friendly people who believe in upholding tradition and our family values,
My father is a Retd. Supritendent Engineer from M. P. Water Resources Department (Irrigation Department) &amp; settled down at Nagpur (Maharashtra) after retirement. He is an open, friendly and lovable person and is particularly good at striking a conversation with anyone. 
My mother is a homemaker par excellence who manages things at home and looks after me, my brother and my sister. She is source of our strength and is the apple of our eyes.
My elder sister (unmarried) has done her M. A. in English Literature, B. Ed. &amp; B. Sc from Jabalpur (M. P. ) and is a Central Government Employee. 
My younger brother (unmarried) has done his B. Com from Jabalpur (M. P.) and planning to do his own business at Nagpur.
We are well settled upper-middle class vegetarian and teetotaler family with progressive views. We are a close knit family of 5 with strong family values and believe that by marriage two families come together along with two individuals. 
Our native is in Madhya Pradesh, where we have ancestral property and extended paternal family members.
We Jaiswala??s (Kalar) are basically Haihayavanshi Kshatriyas (Haihaya is branch of Somavamshiya Kshatriyas).
Most of our relatives are living in Madhya Pradesh &amp; Maharashtra.","Looking for a friendly life partner, who is decent, good looking, well educated, broad-minded &amp;   truly independent girl focused in life but also knows how to enjoy it.

"And here comes the part which I dread the most. Describing myself. I am an extremely straight forward person, cannot beat around the bush. I hate hypocrisy or diplomacy coz I take them as synonymous. Cannot call myself a loner but I am on the quieter side. Though I speak my heart out, I am more of a listener. So I love people around me. All kinds of people. I like small and private parties. I look very conventional and docile but that is my best camouflage. I love scotch and wine. I love to watch movies. And I take a deep interest in religion and society. I am not as eloquent as it comes to a communication professional naturally. So it is being a little difficult for me to tell you about my journey through life. It has been quite eventful. I have at least gone through all the emotions that I can think of. And life has come to me in shades of both black and white and even grey at times. I also had my share of growing up blues and blast offs. But the one thing that has stayed on like a good perfume is my thirst for life itself. It has always been there and I do hope it will make me go through life wandering onto all the roads, some taken by all and some never taken.","It doesn't interest me what you do for a living.

I want to know what you ache for, and if you dare to dream of meeting
your heart longing.

I want to know if you'll risk looking like a fool for love, for your
dreams, for the adventure of being alive.

It doesn't interest me what planets are squaring your moon. I want to
know if you've touched the center of your sorrow. If you've been
opened by it's betrayal s or have become shriveled and closed from
fear of further pain. I want to know if you can sit with your pain,
mine or your own, without moving to hide it, fade it, or fix it.

I want to know if you can dance with wildness and let ecstasy fill you
to the tips of your fingers and toes without cautioning us to be
careful, be realistic, or to remember the limitations of being human.

It doesn't interest me if the story you're telling me is true. I
want to know if you can disappoint another to be true to yourself, if
you can bear the accusation of betrayal and not betray your own soul.

I want to know if you can see beauty even when it is not pretty every
day, and if you can source your life from the creator's presence.

I want to know if you can live with failure, yours or mine, and still
stand on the edge of a lake and shout to the silver of the full moon
""YES!""

It doesn't interest me to know where you live or how much money
you've. I want to know if you can get up after a night of grief and
despair, weary and bruised to the bone, and do what needs to be done.

It doesn't interest me who people say you are, or how you come to be
here. I want to know if you'll stand in the center of fire with me and
not shrink back.

It doesn't interest me where or what or with whom you have studied. I
want to know what sustains you from the inside when all else falls
away.

I want to know if you can be alone with yourself, and if you truly 
like the company you keep in solitude moments.

"I am a happy go lucky person, quite responsible when it comes to life but at the same time never gets disappointed and never loses heart. I keep struggling and try to reach my goals never give up and always keep positive attitude towards life and surroundings, I like straight forwardness. I dona??t like people who talk behind. I had lots of ups and downs in my life, but I believe that is part of life. Life teaches us so many things. Ita??s the best teacher I feel. Some of these lessons are small, or act as a reminder or a??review,a?? and others can be huge and life changing. Some of our greatest learning opportunities come from our most painful experiences. One thing that has taught me a great deal in my life so far is depression. Undoubtedly, most of us would not choose these tough teachers, but it seems that the teachers choose us. The choice that we have is whether to learn and grow from these lessons, or to resist and struggle. Embracing the learning in a situation gives a positive aspect to the worst that can happen in our lives. A few of the biggest truths that I have learned from both the good and bad experiences in my life are: Nothing is ever a??as good as it get.a?? You tend to get what you focus on. There is always a choice. There is always a way. Despite all obstacles ita??s an amazing world. Gratitude is a choice. Whatever our  surroundings, we can create our own sense of space. Your past determines your present, but you determine your future. Applying common knowledge in an uncommon way is the basis of success. It's not magic and anyone can do it.

I believe in being happy and content with all that ALLAH has blessed me with rather than crying over wat i dont possess. Not that i can complain, Allah has been very kind.. I m not a person without faults either but try to improve myself as best as i can. I m God fearing and try to fulfil the basic principles and be a better person. I have respect for my faith and culture &amp; values but also have a modern outlook on things. 

Loyalty is a very important to me. I am loyal to those who are in my life &amp; expect the same in return. I appreciate fine things in life. I like to spend quality time with people who are important to me. I try n`live a balanced life making time for myself, family &amp; friends. I am not superficial. What you see is what you get. 

I believe communication is he essence of any good relationship. I cherish my relaionship with family &amp; friends. They are important part of my life. Apart from spending tme with the loved once I love to spend time with myself. 

I like reading, music, going out, watching movies &amp; traveling. 

WHATS I AM LOOKING IN MY SOULMATE 

I am looking for a decent, family oriented women with good sence of humor &amp; a positive attitude towords life. 

I am searching for my soul mate!A comfortable partner with whom I can be myself. Someone who knows the value of relationships. I am looking someone who will never rob me of the place she gave me in her life &amp; belives that marriage is a life time commitment. Its important that I be able to trust my partner, as she would me. 

I am looking for someone who is not not only my partner but my best friend, someone who is respectful of my feelings, my family &amp; friends, Someone who is attractive to me &amp; has a romantic side. 
My idea of a fulfiling relationship doing funny things together, laugh together, exploring new things together, being together doing nothing, being together in good times life time togetherness is what I am looking for giving space to each other at the same time. Someone who I can love n`cherish for the rest of my life. 
I believe you just once. Give your best &amp; try to get the best out of it. 
Ialso strongly believe that relationships dont work on their own. You make them work. You need to keep nourishing them. Dont ever take them granted. 
If you realy know what it take to make a relationship work, I would love to hear from you",,Tell u letr,28 to 42,21 Nov 1971,,India,Mumbai,Athletic,Doesn't Matter,,,,,,Wheatish ,Doesn't Matter,Self,Other Diploma,"41 yrs, 5ft 9in,<br />

Determine your values and principles. -- I don't know how to choose the right partner but I believe that love and life mate is not about finding the perfect one but finding the one you know perfectly.--and who might be your complimentary companion. -- About me I have a permanent and secured job in central Government of India Under Ministry of defence. --I am issue less widower , my wife died with in two years of my marriage .In detail I will tell you later If destiny knocks. I have lost my best friend, partner ,and the worlds best person .**** Every body expects loving and caring life partner in their life , even I do. I don' know I am loving and caring . or not but I did my best to save my wife by giving her the best treatment in Pune's number one hospital as well all moral support till the end of her life without saying her that she will not survive any more . It is very difficult task to do , smile in front of her in that circumstances . Any way As said there is no end of world and life has to go , so I decided to get married and settle my life -- LIFE IS A BOUQUET,--OF GOOD AND BAD, OF COLOURED AND FRAGNENT FLOWERS, AND OFF COURSE TO BE SHARED WITH SOME SPECIAL PERSON.--THOUGH NO ONE CAN GO BACK AND MAKE A BRAND NEW START , ANY ONE CAN START FROM NOW AND MAKE A BRAND NEW END '---it is hope which builds happy futures.He who does not hope to win has already lost So I hope that I will get a very good and understanding life partner again in my life *ONLY ONE LIFE IS TO LIVE,--IS THE CALCULATION OF ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION --HAPPINESS,SORROWS,PEACE,KNOWLEDGE,WEALTH,POWER ,STATUS,SUCCESS,FRIENDS AND RELATIVES.

"I have been born and brought up in Lucknow. I began my career with PICUP in Lucknow and I worked there for three years and then joined HUDCO Ltd. (A Govt. of India Enterprise) at Lodhi Road, New Delhi. I worked there for five years with stint at Patna. Then I joined Oriental Bank of Commerce at Ahmedabad and after serving there for five years, now i am transferred to Lucknow. I lost my wife in October'2008. I have two lovely kids, one son aged 8 years and one daughter aged 10 years. It was her last wish that I provide a mother to her kids when she is gone because it is a mother, who makes the destiny of a child. I am, looking for a woman who understands the situation and who can hold my hand and carry on the journey of life with me. I will always be there to hold her hand in all circumstances. I am an adventurous person and like traveling and visiting places with my family. I am a self made person and religious too. I am a very straightforward and I like honest and truthful people. I value my thoughts and my beliefs which have never failed me till now.  My marriage was love marriage my wife being kanyakubja brahmin. I am a fearless person because of my upbringing at Sainik School where I studied upto class XII and I believe 'when the going gets tough, the tough gets going'. I believe in simple living and high thinking. Writing me off is easy than knowing me, so all of you who yearn for superfluous and casual relationships please avoid me since I am high on love and commitment and I am very possessive about love and expect the same from my soulmate. I believe that ""Life is like an ice cream eat it before it melts."" I think respect for each other even after having differences and letting go of ego is the way life can be made worth living. Doing things together in the interest of the family has always been my priority.","My soulmate shall be a lady with good moral values. She should be educated enough to understand vice and virtue and take her decisions. A good human being with compassionate and loving heart, she would possess all qualities of a mother, like caring, loving and be forgiving in nature. Would be charming and romantic at heart and accomodating in nature and bond well with my children and act like a bridge between me and them. She would receive due respect for her thoughts and views and will always be held in high esteem and regard and have space of her own.

I believe that I have most of the traits that any lady would look for. But, you need to check out whether the blend is right for you or not. 
Even though I have a high flying career in the Music Industry, I remain deeply grounded as I have some targets to achieve in life. I believe in DESTINY, so never rule out any possibilities in life. 
Even though I had a very brief marriage, but after having gone through tremendous ordeals, I have learnt the harder way that without knowing the person very well one should not proceed for any alliance. Nevertheless, now I am patiently waiting to find the 'Godsend' Ms. Right :-)

"Hello. I am posting this for my brother in law. He is currently teaching English in Korea for the year, and may be available to visit in that country between now and May 2006. He is intelligent, college-educated, and interested in law and English language. He is well-traveled, and has been to places including Russia, Mexico, and Malaysia. He is a wonderful cook, and is very social. He very much enjoys being with friends, and enjoys going out on interesting adventures. He also likes to dance. He is very interested in Indian culture and food, but is also modern in his views of women. He wants a woman who likes to talk with him. He is ready to get married and looks forward to having children, and he hopes to find the right person soon! He is very loving and supportive of your interests and ideas. Once he marries, he would like to stay to live in America, but he enjoys frequent travel outside of his own country.","My brother is very open to various lifestyles and views. The right woman might be a vegetarian or not, modern or traditional, or anything else. He has dated women from different religions, and believes that is it up to the couple to decide how their religious beliefs will impact their relationship and their family. Although things like religion can be very important, he has realized that is can be very difficult to tell if two people will have a good relationship if he will not look at people from a variety of backgrounds. He is a very respectful, open-minded person. Overall, it is up to you and him to see if it works out!

"The profile belongs to a friend of ours who is one of the sweetest and admirable persons we have in our circle. Very unfortunately he was divorced after a very brief marriage of few weeks in 2005. It didn?t last more than a few weeks because of extreme incompatibility and a hassle free divorce by mutual consent followed soon after. Though extremely disappointed he has finally agreed to look at life afresh after persistent pressure from family and friends and we would like our friend to be settled as early as possible and enjoy a blissful married life which he rightly and richly deserves.

He is an M.B.A and works in a senior position in a MNC Firm and has a successful career during which he been posted in various places in India and had a short stint abroad. Despite a fair amount of national and international travelling he is pretty attached to his roots and would probably try out entrepreneurial ventures of his own some day.
 
He has a multifarious and rounded personality and stands out in any crowd. He is an avid reader and is at home with most subjects and in any setting. He has a strong cultural grounding and very refined tastes enjoys a wide range of music and arts starting from modern pop and blues to classical music and cultural events. He enjoys traveling and is passionate about outdoors, nature and wildlife. He used to be good sportsperson in school and college and has extremely high energy levels and is a born athlete. On the looks front he is tall, fair and pretty good looking and looks much younger than his age. He used to carry the tag of the most eligible bachelor of the group until the ill fated accident in his circle. Beyond everything he has a very high sense of moral values and a steadfast determination of sticking to principles. Although he has a modern outlook he also has a strong Indian value system and still believes in the concept of a happy married life and lifelong companionship based on the simple tenets of sharing common goals and bringing up a happy family. He is crazy about children and is the favorite uncle of all his nephews and nieces and little children around.

He is the only son of his family and his father after retirement as a senior officer in the government service tragically passed away a year after retirement. That is also a reason why he had earlier put on hold his marriage to stabilise the family. His mother is a very simple, sweet and affectionate home maker who alternates her time between his sisters and Bhubaneshwar. He has two very lovable younger sisters who are happily married and very well settled. They belong to a very cultured and highly respected family of Orissa now settled in Bhubaneshwar where he has his own house

Since this would be an arranged marriage, it's imminent that the respective families be involved in this discussion at the earliest but having been through one bad experience he would probably like to first interact with the prospective brides? families and if they are comfortable they could then take the issue forward. His only condition is his insistence on an extremely simple marriage. Responses to this profile will be replied directly by him.","They are looking for a girl who obviously has a modern outlook and values Indian systems and realises the importance of discipline along with fun in life. She could be a working professional or not but should be her own person, capable of taking independent decisions and yet care about shared values. A decent educational background is preferred and if she is a working person knowing him he shall make all efforts to support her career. They are looking at some one who could be the daughter in their family rather than a daughter in law. I think the compatibility factor would be high if she has a similar background as theirs.
