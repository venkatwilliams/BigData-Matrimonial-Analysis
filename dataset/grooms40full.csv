"First of All, if you like my profile, than feel free to contact me. If you like my profile but do not contact me than there will be no conversation to go ahead. Just because you accept or I accept your interest does not mean we are committed. Only after talking for few months that we can finally say where we are standing. I am looking for full and frank discussion so that next step is very clear only if it works out between us. I am Kalpen Tripathi, successful qualified CPA working full time and sometimes Saturdays as well if my client requires me. I am working in Membership association- Australian Booksellers Association. I am a very loving &amp; caring person but in return I want the same. I go out of my way to help people and do not expect anything in return. As Vedas says, all is one. I am not religious at all but will help my wife with religious activities. I am friendly and cheerful and like dancing. I am highly motivated, super hard working and competitive. Presently I am learning to Cook- trying to be like Sanjeev Kapoor in Khana Khazana-hahah. I only drink one glass of champagne, best Red/White wine once in a while with dinner but I am more into meditation and do not believe in drinking. I am a divorcee and Seriously considering long term permanent relationship. PLEASE DO NOT APPLY WITHOUT PHOTO. I am not going to accept any interest without your picture as I do not know whom I am accepting to talk to. Wife as a friend, companion in all aspect of life.

"I am a simple person who is a true worshiper of god and never loses faith in him. Further, I always stay calm and patient in order to avoid the problems of life and lead a happy life ahead. 
In my professional life I am currently working as a manager with a reputed firm. My work has taught me a lot of things in life and has helped me grow. I am very happy and satisfied with my profession and in near future I would like to excel in my career. I believe in doing hard work in order to make a special position in life. 
My parents are my role model and I give them sheer importance in my life. My mother is a homemaker and father has taken retirement from his profession. I also have a lovely sister who is married and well settled in her life. 
In my higher education sector I have completed B Sc and MBA from Utkal University. 
The list of my friends is very short and I like to spend my time with them. Whenever I am with them I forget all my problems and freely enjoy the time. In my free time I like to watch movies with them and travel.","Marriage is not just a mere term; it is a lifelong relationship in which both the individuals have to maintain a trust line which will make their relationship successful. 
The girl, whom I will get married to, should be well qualified and must be from a decent family. She should be simple and caring. I want her to be homely so that she can take good care of the family needs and other responsibilities. 
She should be an understanding and mature female with a broader aspect of looking at life and judging the situations accordingly. I would really appreciate if she is able to adapt herself in my family and bind them in a beautiful and pure bond of love. 
My life partner will get the liberty of choosing her career from my side. I respect the individuality of each and every person so my wife will also get the freedom to work after marriage. I will always be there to support her. Further, I am ready to share the responsibilities after marriage which will lessen her burden. 
As I am an emotional person therefore, I expect my life partner to not make fun of me and rather should understand and help me overcome it.
I assure her a happy and prosperous future if she is like the one I have always desired for.

"I would describe myself as a simple and down to earth person who has a positive outlook towards life. This has helped me learn a lot good things about life and neglecting the negative thoughts. I respect my family members and their values. 
In my professional life I like to work sincerely and with full dedication. Presently I am working as a manager with CMC Bangalore. My work has taught a lot in life so in my future I would like to continue in the same field and prosper. 
My mother is a homemaker and father has taken retirement from his profession. I have three brothers who are successfully working in their respective professions. One of my brothers is working as an accountant in a reputed firm and the other one is working with a renowned organization as a CFO and my other brother is currently pursuing his DBM final year. 
My schooling was smooth and I was a bright student of my class. After completing my school I did my B Com from Mangalore University and CA from Bangalore.
Apart from my busy work schedule I like to spend my time listening to music, watching TV and reading books of my interest.","I want a simple and sober life partner who understands me and my lifestyle well. This way it will be easy for both of us to adjust nicely with each other. 
She should be working, as I like the passion and confidence of the working people. Further, she will have a practical and broader aspect of looking at life. My wife should be well educated and qualified so that both of us can understand each others profession well. 
I would prefer a girl who is from Bangalore. The family of my life partner should have a decent image in the society. 
According to me decision of getting married is very important and should be taken very sensibly. I am ready to get married and share the responsibilities with my wife. As it is not only the duty of the female to take care of the home and the family members. Rather it is a mutual task which should be done together.
I won't feel ashamed in helping my wife in the task at home rather I would feel proud to do that. This way we will understand each other more closely and will also deepen our relation. 
If she matches with my conditions I have mentioned then I am ready to share my life and happiness with her.

"Helping people is not just for social service. It is for a personal satisfaction too. I am very helpful  person and try to help needy people as much as I can. Helping people is not a selfless service as helping others makes me respect myself more.  
Since childhood I was like that and because of this I have made many friends and I am in the good books of my relatives too. I think this asset of mine is because of my parents. I am very proud to say that I am like them and will be the same in future no matter what happens. 
Professionally, I am a Lecturer in IT. I did my Engineering and then joined this field. I always wanted to get into this and I achieved what I desired with my dedication towards my goal. I want to excel in the same field in future and I am sure of achieving it as I am very dedicated. 
My father is retired and my mother is a homemaker. What I am not proud of in myself is my lethargic nature. I get tired of things very easily and just let them be. However, that does not mean that I do not complete my work on time. I try to be as up to dated as I can with my work. 
Apart from that, I like to sing. I like being connected to the world and I try the same by watching television and reading newspaper.","The girl I get married to should preferably be from Delhi and this is because I am myself settled there. In addition, she should have a complete idea of the city, which is only possible, if she is a resident of Delhi. This will be an advantage for her because she will not have to leave her parents for a long time and can meet them whenever she wants. 
She needs to be beautiful by both heart and mind as this is my family  preference. I expect my partner to be cheerful. 
Her family should be very fair(just), as I do not want them to cheat us in any way. Apart from that, she should be working as I am very modern as a person and feel that women are as good as a man, as far as work is concerned. 
I am ready to take responsibilities at home or outside home. If she is supportive, I will also help her in taking care of our kids in future. 
I am very liberal and she can feel as free as she wants when she is around me. I will give her a lot of space too. I am sure if she is what I have always been dreaming of, I will give her a lot of happiness.

"Life is fun. Enjoy It, Life is challenge. Overcome It, Life is full of opportunities. Grab It, etc Life is good and it can only get better with a positive attitude &amp; open mind. 

I am from a family that values, cares and respects others. I got the opportunity to live in India and Australia plus traveling around has broadened my spectrum of thinking and adapting. I am a simple and down to earth person. I believe in humanity, caring, sharing and treating each other with respect. Life is a journey with many phases, situations, friends and family which builds a person within. I am a person with a passion to explore new things and live life to the fullest. I am a person who loves to travel, play sports, listen to music, keeping fit, cooking, trying new edible stuff, adventure (sky diving, bungee Jumping ), driving, being spontaneous, etc. 

I am born and bought up is western part of India (Gujrat). I did my B.Sc Comp. (Gujarat) &amp; Master of Comp Management. I migrated to Brisbane in 2003 from Pune (India) and have been working for the government as IT Project Manager.

For me marriage is more than just an official sign off. I consider marriage is about building a great relationship and become the best friend for life to enjoy each moment and support each other with honest communication, trust, love, care, understanding and adjustments. A partner should become your strength than limitation to achieve the dreams together and enhance each others life.

If you feel our thinking is on the same wave length, please get in touch. Thank you for your time.

"My Friends, Please hold your breath and read the following in BOLD. Here I go...

Life is not all roses as they say.... but at the same time its no way thorns only. So enjoy whatever you can and for whatever you cannot just remember one thing, 'This too shall pass'. This is me, in short.

God knows why I look so serious in photographs. I wish I were more photogenic. So, all said and done, I believe in enjoying all that life has to offer. I like, I value and I understand ('understand'??? Well, it's my belief) what a A True Relationship is. I have a balanced approach towards life and for that matter.. for everything else too.

I like being straighforward and with my friends I am pretty straightforward. Thankfully God has given me such friends who understand me and appreciate and respect me for what I am. It's a bliss.... That's the reason my engeries increase multiple times when I am with my such close friends. Though, I do not claim to give my life away for them, but showing ignorance when a friend is in need is not me, for sure. In my spare time (whatever I get) I surf the net . Also, I love to go for an outing, watch TV, movies, play games and what not(Few of the english movies I like are Dan in Real Life, The Wanted, Jumper &amp; the fairy tale Stardust). Sometimes life will allow me to do all that I want, at other times it won't. So, I have to respect her and agree to what she says. There are so many things about me and I can continue to talk and write about me and my qualities for hours together.. :-) but we have to act mature at times and keep ourselves within sane limits :-) .... at the same time, give a chance to others... So I stop here for 'about myself'. And of course, there is always an opportunity to know more if we are interested... Isn't it?

For me, in life, love, mutual trust and understanding form the foundation for a lasting relationship.. ! Which is what, my quest is here.

Marriage is a one time affair. So, being straighforward again, what am I looking for?.... Ah... I am Looking For... a great friend, nice person, life partner, sweet lady, mature girl and just a beauty, overall. God...!!! I am sure such thing exists...!!!

Take care.... All the best.... !... Amar Jhingan.

about me i am broad minded, fun loving person. though i am a book warm, my eyes never needed for power glasses. 
when i meet new people, they use to say that i am very matured comparing to my 28 yrs. i never confused them by saying 34. 
i love travelling, adventures, romantic and comedy movies. 
swimming in a pool, playing with kids, chatting with friends, reading books, watching fish love, sitting alone in a temple and sea shore allows me to forget this whole world.
i am in a long way to release a book and a short film soon.

"It will not be out of context to mention here that recently I goy my Green Card for USA and was there in Jan-Feb 2009 to assess job prospects. I have not yet made up my mind whether to move to USA or not. Everything depends on the events in the near future. 

About my first marriage : Divorced and have a daughter out of my first marriage but as per the settlement clause the custody is with the mother and in future I can not claim guardianship of my daughter. It was a mutual separation 

About My Self :I belong to Patna. But have completed most of my education outside Patna. Did my schooling from The Scindia School Gwalior, graduation from Allahabad University and finally my MBA from Indian Institute Of Business Management, Patna. Started my career from Patna and my first job was with Reliance Telecom.. After I left Reliance, have been traveling across north India with different companies ( Bajaj Auto, TELCO, ICICI Bank ). Finally got a chance to shift to Pune in 2004. Since then I have been in Pune, presently working as a Zone Head - West ( Sr Manager ) with an Insurance Company. 

What I've Learned from Past Relationship: Flossing is important. Laughing is essential. Perfection is impossible. It's better to understand than to be understood. Laughter can save a relationship; lack of laughter can kill it. Finally, you must expose yourself emotionally -- it's the only way to reap love's greatest rewards. (These are few of my dos and dont's)

Something about my self :- Have a good sense of humor, have a strong willpower and believe in enjoying even the simplest things in life, smart, good to look at, a heart full of love and compassion. A strong believer in karma and hard work. Family is my ultimate strength. I canAA?A?t imagine my life without my family. Traditional yet tolerant to all religions and views. I seek what I can commit and that is honesty, support, love, care and companionship at all times. I am a self made, confident guy, highly impressive personality. Well cultured, good communication skills, widely traveled, very practical, have seen many hardships in life, highly professional n well organized person. Have a passion for outdoor adventurous sports, love to travel, enjoy spending time at home with family, one can say a very lively person in my office and my friend circle and off course in my family too. Oh yes one more thing at times love to cook also. 

I am looking for practical happy and lively girl who will be joy to all. Sweet natured professional girl. A person who would walk with me in each &amp; every phase of life. 

After having gone through one committed relationship, I may be rusty about this courting stuff, but I'm not jaded by divorce. It's even clearer to me that there's not just one person out there. And even if you get lucky and meet a winner, there's a mountain of work ahead, no matter what. It's knowing that the work is worth it, that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, which redeems the institution of marriage. I came to the point that I am longing for a stable love life again. I love having a stable, loving warm relationship where you can trust a person with your most dear secrets. It is impossible to describe here the ideal relationship. love, passion, respect, warmth and aching fears that this bliss might end one day...... It is morning coffees together before work, occasional phone call during the day to make sure you are ok, evening suppers in front of the TV, long hikes when you don\'t say much to each other but silently agree that the world is a beautiful place.... same directions in a long journey of life and mutual understanding that sometimes it is necessary... A promise that one will stand by forever. Tolerance. Kindness. Decency. Love.",Looking for the one who loves to love her family. So we are looking for practical happy and lively girl who will be joy to all.

"I keep an open mind and experience and try new things whenever I can. When I find something I truly enjoy, I dive into it with a passion and commitment until I see it through to fruition. I am never truly content as I am always looking for new challenges so that I can continue growing and expanding my horizons. 

I am into movies and have a decent collection going. I do not buy just anything. I must really like the movie or it has to have unique qualities about it in order for me to purchase it. When I do, I seek out the best version of it whether it is from North America or Japan. My movies range in taste from:

thoughtful dramas (eg A Beautiful Mind/What Dreams May Come) to

comedies (eg Rat Race) to

pure fantasy (eg The Matrix/Star Wars). 

Depending on the kind of day I have at work, in the evening, I play music that is the opposite of that to keep a balance in my life. For example, if I had a really hard and intense day, I play music by Enigma, Enya, Delerium, Deep Forest, or something else that is mellow and soothing. If I had a really boring day, I play progressive house, trance, or anything else that has a nice beat to it. Unofficially, I have the title of Mood Music Manager at work as I create what I like to call sonic landscapes during the day. 

I may be a techno-geek with all the stuff around me all day long, but I am also a nature lover. I like being outdoors just to feel the ocean breeze on a warm day, to smell the sweet air after the rain, to listen to the birds, to just sit in quiet contemplation. Whenever I can, I watch the kinds of shows they have on Animal Planet or PBS where animals or the outdoors is the focus, or about our surroundings in general including what is beyond our planet. 

Does it look like I enjoy eating? YouA?AAA?AAA?Ad guess right! I like to cook and experiment with new recipes when I have time. I like trying foods from different cultures. I guess that is easy in Vancouver since there are so many restaurants of all ethnic origins and diversities. 

When it comes down to it, there is not much I don't like. I certainly HATE people that are rude, crude, insensitive, have no feelings for anyone except for themselves or those who impose their beliefs on others. I have a list of other things, but they would be too petty to mention. 

I am a pretty easy going guy and usually turn the other cheek. In the business that I am in, I have to be. If, however, someone were to push me far enough (and believe me it takes a lot to do that) be warned, I can become just as nasty and then some! 

There is also the silly side of me. I like keeping things light with humour and comedy, but when it comes to something needs to be done which requires all my resources, become focused and intense. 

I am analytical and inquisitive by nature. I want to know how things work, why things are the way they are, and what makes us who we are. 

My biggest fear is not meeting someone elses expectations when I have set out to do something through my own will, or when asked to do so. I rarely say no. Normally, it does not matter what anyone thinks about me, whether you like me, hate me, or are indifferent so long as I have not given reason for you to feel that way. If I have given someone a reason not to like me, I will try whatever I can to correct that. 

I have no expectations of anyone else except for respect and admiration so long as (s)he thinks I have earned it and not because I think I deserve it. 

I do not ask for favours or help from anyone unless, under very rare circumstances, I have exhausted all of my own resources. 

Whenever I reach one, I pause for a moment and look for the next one (unless of course it is the end of the road)",,,27 to 35,22 Mar 1973,,Canada,Others,Average,Average,,Gujarati,Gujarati,,,Wheatish ,Fair,Self,Other Diploma,"40 yrs, 5ft 10in,<br />

"Hi, IA?m Alex. IA?ve done my MBA and work in the Engineering dept. of a reputed airline. IA?m an ambivert (I like my solitude a wee bit more than others though), love to laugh. Moderate as far as religion and traditions are concerned. Religion is important to me but at a personal level. Overt / vociferous proclamations of faith is not my cup of tea. Simplicity and ingenuousness are character traits I admire most in people. Ostentation puts me off. Reading, creative writing &amp; trekking are my passions. Ours is a nuclear family comprising of my retired parents and myself. I have an elder brother who is a doctor, married and is currently working abroad.

My ideal partner would be a woman (not a girl mind you) who is mature and open minded. Should be educated (i.e knowledgeable to contribute to society as opposed to amassing degrees) Should be employed so as to independently earn a livelihood as opposed to working to hoard wealth. Religion or ethnicity is no bar to me, as I believe that a mind guided by love and reason would any day be better than what any of the religions could ever conjure up.","My ideal partner would be a woman (not a girl mind you) who is mature and open minded.

"Hi there!! I am Bhavesh Mehta. 

I have lived   travelled   studied in Western Europe. Travelling to different places &amp; make friends is one of my deep interest. Now i have friends in many parts of the world. After having this long trip to Europe, presently i am teaching as well as working on large scale planning and Urban design projects in India and South Asia. 

My friends told me that i am honest, smart, clever, simple and fun loving person! I believe when you take difficult situation in life with sense of humor then life goes easy. 

I like to see entertaining movies, shows and musicwise like Salsa, Jazz, Rock &amp; Blues. 

Listening to instrumental music in early morning makes my day calm and good. I try to go to swimming every day and i believe its best exercise for body and mind. I like to be part of debate and enjoy philosophical discussions. I think thats the way to develop one's self. 

Marriage is a social institution where each member share responsibility. Without love marriage is meaningless. Understanding each other is the most important aspect for me. By arrangement two people can meet and perhaps by meeting more the flower of love develops in garden of mysterious life. Honesty is the fundamental base for any long term relationship. 

True partner walk besides each other, not in front, not in back.

"Thanks for visiting my profile.

I am entering some basic details about myself. I am currently pursuing my doctoral studies in Strategic Management at the University of Pennsylvania (Wharton school) and expected to complete in 2010. I have completed my MBA from US and worked in the industry for a total of five years (3 years as software engineer at Cognizant and 2 years as financial analyst at the World Bank in Washington DC). I did my bachelors in Electrical Engineering from JU (Kolkata). 

Besides reading, I love to sing and listen to music. I like traveling, hiking, and going on long drives. I can cook a limited range of bengali dishes. Soccer is a favourite game, and I play whenever I can find the opportunity. 

My parents stay in India. Father was a Marketing Manager (and is now retired), and Mother is a lecturer of Physics in college. Only sister has just finished her doctoral studies in US after doing bachelors in engineering from JU (Kolkata), and is now pursuing Post-Doctoral research in US.

I am happy to provide further details as requested.

More about me Very adventurous, love Traveling and touring places, watching lot of movies, Socialising &amp; playing Pranks anywhere and everywhere Yes thats probably little childish but i believe we all have a child within us which should get explored to live life with lots of FUN. 

I Respect all religion &amp; believe that Love &amp; Humanity is essential for living.","I am looking for a life partner with whom communicating, understanding and sharing life will come naturally and together we can share and achieve our dreams.

"have to share: a loving heart, a caring touch, sparkle, a vigor for life, ""sense and sensibility"", a strong shoulder and value system. A dash of risk taking and outdoors are part of my regulars, ( most reoccurring dream is to backpack to Amazon with the ladylove on a yatch/boat, a pot of coffee, soothing music and sharing ""life lessons"" in the wilderness. 

Sometimes I enjoy cooking and have an eye for interior decoration, I am a bit lazy at times and hate mundane chores but make up in doing other things. (part timer)
I have also learnt that ""big pleasures are achieved by enjoying little things in life"", and life is not as hard as it looks! 

I am presently working as a senior consultant and ""make more than a Loaf"", I am ambitious and have: ""miles to go before I sleep (Robert frost's half Q). 

Part of my musical expressions are Jazz, RnB, Hip Hop and bit of rock and roll. I also enjoy films (english and Hindi). 

I am not an avid reader but I do read once in a while. 

that said.. Let's talk!","I would like to meet some who is an independent thinker with an ""undercurrent of feminist streak"", someone who is deeply engaged in life, a bit unconventional and someone who takes life head on, a forward thinking girl. 
A woman who knows when to lead, follow and be neutral, a charming personality with wits, and sense of belonging to her man!

Women are infact a ""superior breed"" but fragile for men to handle, I guess the secret to understanding a woman lies in having a pair of ""great ears"" and attaching value to woman's perspective. 

I am an affectionate person and want someone to resonate with me.

"Hello,

As you would have rightly figured out, I am serious in getting married and I will not disappoint you with messing attitudes (and neither will I want such attitude in return, so if you are curious or a time waster, please do not show an interest in me).  So if you are still interested in me (trust me, I am not very photogenic), please can you email me at Harpal73 at live dot co dot uk with your brief description, your clear and recent photo and your phone number and I will promise to call you, and I am sure we can chat and meet mutually (I believe it is important to meet and not to judge by the book cover, then after meeting we can decide accordingly).

Ok so here is a bit about me...

My name is Harpal.  I live in East London in Stratford (where the 2012 Olympic is being organised, as Stratford is quite popular for that to some extent).  I was born in Kenya Mombasa and my parents came to London when I was 2 years old (so I am a British citizen).  My family origin is from Amritsar India.  I am 1973 born making me 36 years old (though some people have said I look younger, hmm nice compliment I guess).  I am 5'9"" in height (175cm) and about 75 kg in weight.  I am of slim/medium build, smart appearance, fair skinned with black hair and brown eyes and when I smile, I have a dimple on my right cheek (hmm I hope that is good to have).  I am clean shaven (not turban). I am of Sikh religion (Ramgarhia caste) though caste does not matter to me, as I feel caste doesn't measure the true compatibility of a person's characteristics.  I have graduated in MBA Business Administration.  I work for the NHS as a Team Coordinator in a London hospital in East London.  I have never been married.  I enjoy martial arts, gym, music, movies, theatres, driving (I have my own car), travelling, going out and socialising.  I am known to be a person who is easy to get along with, caring, loving, romantic (well waiting for the right girl to share this with), honest and friendly.  I am a family orientated person without doubt.  I do not smoke and I do not drink and I prefer to eat vegetarian (just health conscious you can call me).  I do believe in God, but do not have time to go to the temple every day.  I have a slight accent despite the fact I have grown up in London all my life (basically when I was a child, I had a speech impairment which till now has never caused any barrier to my personal life).  I have a good blend of both eastern and western cultures.","Ok, enough about me (wow thanks for reading up to this sentence), so...

What I am looking for in a girl, well someone who is a single, sweet (and romantic) and a nice Punjabi girl, who is looking for a soul mate / life partner.  The girl also must be educated and well mannered, someone who likes to be happy and enjoy life and who respects family values.  A non smoker and a non drinker, or at least not an alcoholic drinker.  It does not matter if she eats vegetarian or non vegetarian. A girl who knows the house stuff (i.e. cooking, cleaning, ironing, etc) that I hope is not too much to ask for (from an Indian culture perspective).  Someone who will see her life partner as a husband as well as her best friend (as both partners need to be dependent on each other to some extent to have a successful marriage life - i.e. a man cannot live happily in a relationship without his woman and vice versa - this is true , do you agree?).  Someone between 5'1"" and 5'7"" in height, born after 1975 and of slim or average build.  As I said above, caste is not an issue for me and neither is the education discipline or work status.  A person's inner characteristics and understanding for a lifetime relationship is of most importance.

If you feel I am the man you are looking for, you know what to do (if you have read all of my profile)... Thanks for reading... xx",,20 to 35,07 Jun 1973,18:05:00,United Kingdom,Others,Average,Doesn't Matter,,Ramgariah,,Others,,Very Fair ,Doesn't Matter,Self,MBA/PGDM,"40 yrs, 5ft 9in,<br />

Hobbies: Music has always interested me in a big way. I am interested in percussion instruments and play the Drums and Tabla.

I also play badminton, do some juggling, some photography, some jogging etc.
