"Hello there:

First of all Thank you for stopping by.  You will notice stereo type boiler plate boring description such as "".....down to earth, straight forward, good sense of humour...etc.."" in most of the profiles, of course with few exceptions. It is not fair to evaluate or judge our self or to do our own rating. If I do, I may tend to favor myself by giving     positive description on all fronts. So I leave it to U and request you to get in touch with me to know more and better by phone or profile name with yahoo dot kom and make your own independent evaluation that would be far more accuarate and fair.  However I would like to provide factual description about me that I am educated in India and later in the United States and have worked there for several years prior to current assignment here in city beautiful Chandigarh. I occassionally travel abroad as and when profession requires. I am vegetarian, non-smoker, non-alcohalic by choice.

I am confident you won't regret if you get in touch with me.  Still I wish U good luck in your search. Please get in touch with me by adding yahoo to my profile and I will be glad to provide details you may need to proceed further in the right direction.  

With warm regards !

"Dear Miss,

Hi. I'm a UK citizen and am divorced with 2 children (10 and 12 yrs old), and they live with their mother.

I am looking to start again with a loving, faithful, and fun loving person. I am a successful banker and am young at heart with lots of ambition to continue to succeed in work and life.

I love to travel, am romantic, and enjoy socialising with people, and dancing. I relax by watching movies, reading, fishing, painting, and am very interested in history and science. I am kind and generous and believe that a man should provide for his family and wife.

I was born and raised in the UK and am one of 4 sons to immigrant Indian parents who came to the UK in the early 60s. My ex-wife if English and we enjoy friendly relations dispite the divorce, and I see me kids reguarly.

Please only reply if you strongly feel that you could cope and accept my current situation, and if you're willing to take a chance to get to know me.

Thanks &amp; kind regards,
Andrew","I am looking for a dependable, fun loving, faithful, and intelligent lady to share my privileged life with.

"Simplicity and honesty are the two adjectives that describe a good human being the best. I am one of those people and feel blessed to have inherited these qualities. People around me appreciate me for the same and I am in the good books of many people I like. 
I am very practical as a person. This has helped me in being up to date with the world. I do not believe everything anyone says. I need reasons to believe people. Being reasonable has helped me in increasing my knowledge. 
I am a business man and I deal with tours and travels. I like my work and I find it very interesting. I hope I get success in this field. If I do, I will be grateful to the people who have helped me. 
My mother is a homemaker and my brother is a business man. He is married and his wife is homemaker. I lost my father and now I miss him a lot. I will always miss him and no one can take his place. I take care of my family and can do anything they ask me to do. 
I am quite modern as a person and that I think is something good in me. Being modern is very important in todaya??s scenario, as one cannot adjust if one is traditional. 
When I get some time off, I like to listen to music and watch movies. I also like travelling to different places.","I will prefer marrying a girl from Mumbai because if she is from there she will already be aware of the area plus she will be familiar with the culture and customs people follow there. This way she will take less time in adjusting.
Also, if she is from Mumbai she can visit her parents whenever she misses them without travelling much. 
She should be educated as I value education more than anything else. If she is educated, she will be a decent person automatically. She needs to be very loyal. This will not only make her win my trust but will also help me in sharing things with her as this is something that is very important for a sound and a healthy relationship. If we both are loyal to each other, we can become a good couple.
When a person gets married, the whole family has to love each other and respect each other. I will expect the same from my partner. She should be very respectful towards my parents and elders in my family. If she respects them, I am sure I will give her parents the same respect. 
I am very honest as a person and I will expect the same honesty in my partner. A relationship is a weak thread. It gets weaker if people are not honest with each other. I am sure that our relationship will get stronger if we will be loyal and honest to each other.

"I am an outgoing person that you will trust and you can rely on easily. I want to have a peaceful life with an understanding person. I donA?t like to talk about everything now but it seems necessary to mention that I've been to a number of different countries as either trip or study that my longest stay was in the UK to study. 

Regarding my education, I'm a general practitioner by degree, but I was in the UK to complete a post-grad degree in bioengineering. I was rather successful with my studies but unfortunately, I ran into trouble with my supervisor and my sponsor. I could have completed the work if and only if I could stay in the UK. At that time, I was in the UK on student visa and though I found suitable positions to fit but according to the UKs regulations I had to leave there and re-enter and it was not possible at the time. The only way to pursue my post-grad work was to get married there that even it was suggested by some of my British friends. 
But unlike many other people, to marriage me was not the solution to staying in the UK because IA?ve always thought about marriage as a permanent relationship and not something to sort out visa problems!!!

Now, I have put this ad to find a match to sort both my study problem and my private life problem. Again, I would like to say that IA?m not after finding a person to solve my visa problem and though completing my studies are very precious to me but marriage is something I donA?t like to risk on and I want to be with someone to really enjoy all aspects of life!

To be honest with you I'm looking for a good match particularly in the US, the UK, or Canada that specially for the latter I can immigrate there but I prefer to get married and settled at once. 

Anyway, if you think youA?re the one that could make me happy for the rest of my life, please drop a few lines ASAP!!!
