"Hi, 

Thanks for visiting my profile. Let's start our relationship with trust and truth. My name is Ravi Kumar Gokanakonda. I follow truth and value human. I stand for it at any cost or price. 

This feeling for you: To-be spouse and her family I value you as a human and respect you as my own family. Please do not count me with religion or caste. Such act disturbs me and trusts me that will be the day we will spoil our own life. No individual man or woman on this earth is perfect including I and you. We (after united and take responsibilities as WIFE and Husband) can become PERFECT with the union of our unique positive energies, ethics and moral values.

To know the sweetness of the fruit, at any cost you need to taste it. In the same way, you can only know the person by starting a relationship with him instead of value the religion tag or caste label. I am ready to know you by starting the relationship. Are you open for the same?

I have a special respect towards Indian traditional woman. Though, I am modern but traditional values takes precedence than modern values. Marriage and marriage life will not be complete without two parameters which I will discuss with only my to-be spouse and my to-be family members along with my current family members.

I follow legitimate values for all the community which develops me as true human. Let?s talk more in our next communication. Thanks for your time and I hope you will be blessed with happiness, pleasure and treasure in life.

Greetings",,Before I share about my family I gym 3-5 days a week . I have parents and one younger sister who is married. Father is retired Grade 1 officer in minerals exploring company.

"Hello, this is Savita Vishwanathan. I've been living in Mumbai since birth. Well, not sure how much of a description will help you understand the real me, but in a nutshell, I'm a fun loving, caring, trustworthy individual.I completely believe in the institution of marriage and am in it for the long haul. But I also want my marriage to be one based on mutual love, respect and lots of fun (unlike what most marriages turn out to be these days). Which is why the search for the right partner is so very crucial to me and I'd like to spend sometime knowing you before making any decision. 

What am I looking for in my partner? - well, someone who's smart, is well spoken and has a good persona...understands relations...believes in love...wants to stay by his partner's side through thick and thin....believes in having a conversation...has a good sense of humor! Someone who shares my values and believes in being a friend first and then a partner. Life is not easy, but its fun to share tough times with someone who loves and respects you.Communication is key, so someone who is fluent in English and Hindi would really help (considering my malayalam is just awesome ;) ))...If you think I am what you are looking for in your partner. We can take it forward from there!
If u like my profile, drop me a line....if not, all the best for your search! Hope u find your soulmate soon:)","Looking for someone who's smart, is well spoken and has a good persona...understands relations...believes in love...wants to stay by his partner's side through thick and thin....believes in having a conversation...has a good sense of humor! - for starters Hope I'm not asking for too much :)","Family consists of dad who is retired, mom is a housewife.

"About me: 
Outgoing, optimistic, highly personable.  Believe in adapting the best of global and Indian values.

I have always interacted with people from various walks of life. And it continually enriches me.

I firmly believe that family and friends are our anchors and it's essential to support, help and encourage everyone around us to lead a better life.

I believe there is a spiritual guide for us, and it encompasses the religion we follow and the deities we worship. 

I'm fond of books, advertising, brands, movies, music, culture and travel. I collect vintage ads and have a collection of books, music and movies.

I've travelled across most parts of India and some places abroad in childhood days. Plan and hope to see much more of the world.

I love exploring the cultural nuances that exist around and beyond us.

Educational Qualifications:
1) MMS (Master of Management Studies, Silver Medalist). 2) B.Com (awarded Best Degree College Student) from University of  Mumbai. 
3) Schooled in a Bandra convent school.

Professional:
Associate Director in a MNC advertising agency. Role - strategy planning for digital brand campaigns. Annual income - INR 10+ lacs.
Aim to balance home and work life in the future.","Expectations for Spouse:
Education and professional outlook are key. Post-graduate and above would enable us to have similar outlooks.
Should be able to balance his professional focus and be family-oriented. Should look forward to raising family.
A sociable person/extrovert would perhaps be more compatible with my personality type. Someone who share some of my interests and passions such as traveling and exploring interesting life experiences.
I'm not an avid sports fan and don't subscribe to the national fascination for cricket. 
Would also prefer a non-smoker. ","Father - Formerly, Chief Engineer in the Merchant Navy (SCI) and has been in offshore shipping since 1990. 

Mother - M.Sc., B. Ed., taught for a couple of years in schools like Apeejay and Kendriya Vidyalaya. Continues to tutor children.

Younger brother -  B.A. (Economics), works in a media agency.

I?m thankful for being raised in a family where education and careers have been of paramount importance. We have had a well-rounded upbringing with rich experiences. We've been in Bombay since 1983.

Our extended families, maternal and paternal, reside across Gurgaon, Panchkula and throughout Northern India.

My deep rooted desire, to make my marriage. the most cherished gift of my life, wherein  bestowed with a thoughtful and loving soul mate, we work towards a superb partnership, of constructively contributing.. to the happiness of people around us and in turn discover the best in each other.


What Am I Looking For?

Simplicity. Respect. Clarity in thoughts n speech and purity in deeds. All this with a realization..that we all are imperfect with a goal towards perfection.

Education &amp; Values are eternal gifts that never fade away with times.And for the rest of the talents and skills , have childlike curiosity to learn &amp; imbibe them...with a terrible bad luck in sports, not giving up though! Perhaps it is testimony to the fact that I am a perfect citizen of Planet Venus minus that macho abilities of residents of Mars!!","Balances Idealism with Pragmatism at right times. Absolutely Self Made &amp; Self Respecting.

Trusts the choices made by the better half, as far as decisions pertaining to her life goes. I have many a times back tracked my ambitions to the needs of my loved ones.. &amp; my sensitivities dominate my intellect, to continue to do the same, for my future family. Might choose to work for our happiness, or might sacrifice work, to be with them, for our strong bonding.Am unpredictable in this regard..excuses n acceptances!

Let the good old hindi film ideas of true love and eternal romance be part of my married life.","Close Knit. Loving but keen on discipline.

I see myself as an optimist and a social person who has passion for life. I have grown in a traditional Hindu household valuing and respecting my parents, seniors and everyone else. Although we observe Hindu values and beliefs, our entire family supports the activities of a Buddhist organization. I love music from Hindi classical to hip hop and anything that has great beats. I occasionally cook-not that i cant cook. I love keeping fit and therefore give health a top priority. I love travelling as well if i have the right company. I am well read and grounded in education with law as my domain (both bachelors and masters). Still my profession requires me to updated with all recent laws and amendments. I am a person who loves business news and would squeeze time for my TV channel. I also love technology and gadgets. I am seeking a friend for life who could complement and complete me with his qualities. I would love to meet someone who is mentally compatible with me.",,,28 to 33,22 Jun 1980,09:12:00,India,Delhi,Average,Doesn't Matter,0 brothers ,Arora,,,Delhi University,Wheatish ,Doesn't Matter,Self,BL/LLB/BGL (Law),"33 yrs, 5ft 2in,<br />

Having said that,I think it is equally important to maintain a balance between professional &amp; personal life to relish whatever you have achieved. As far as my interests go , have a varied list. I enjoy learning new things be it dance, vocal music, yoga. Experimenting and trying out different cuisines. I believe honesty, trust and loyalty should be the essence of any relationship. And marriage is a beautiful institution which makes life more meaningful with the right companion.",,We are a respected business family settled in Chandigarh. My Family includes my mother who is home maker and equally active in family business and brother who has completed his studies and has joined the family business. My father passed away in May 2005.

She?s an independent individual who loves challenges &amp; excitement and she?s ready to face any result of her own decision. Her friends love and trust her. And she'll be the first they come to when they are in need of someone to speak their heart out. They say she?s very sensitive, a good listener and caring for her loved ones more than anything else. She doesn?t care for good/bad words people say about her but cares when those words are for her loved ones. She?s shy by nature; She?s patient, imaginative &amp; target oriented.

When she foresees anything wrong, her sixth sense is what saves her from falling in traps. She tries to hide her disagreement under smiling face. her friends say that this is a charming quality of her.

"The reason why human beings are different from animals is because they are well cultured. This is the basic thing that I look in a person when I meet him. This criterion has always been very successful for me to judge people. I am a very well cultured person myself and that is what I also appreciate in people. 
I have been the same since childhood. My parents inculcated this in me and I am very thankful to my parents for that. I am sure this will always remain in me because I respect myself for this nature of mine. 
I am a Business Analyst in an MNC and I like my job. I dona??t crib about my work like many other people do. I would like to continue with my work and grow in the same field but if in future, I have some problems managing my work and my family I can leave working. 
My mother is a homemaker and my father is the Vice president in a software company. I find my parents the best people on earth and I appreciate their love and affection towards me. I pray to god that they make me efficient enough that I can give them whatever they expect from me. 
My school life was quiet smooth and after that, I did B tech from Wadia College in Pune. 
I have a very creative nature and I like doing things that are out of the box. I like to decorate flowers and watch movies.","He should be well settled. This will make him very eligible for me, as settled people do not have the tension and pressure at that level. He will himself feel very relaxed if he is settled. Also, I dona??t want to struggle after marriage and want to live a peaceful life. 
I am strictly against the habit of smoking cigarettes and consuming alcohol. I think these things just create nuisance in the family. They not only spoil the heath of the people who are consuming it but also harm those who remain close to them.  
When two people marry each other, they not only have to have a relationship with each other but also with each othera??s families. I hope the man I get married to has a good family so that I can adjust with them and love them like my own family. 
I am very lovable and caring therefore, I will expect the same from my partner too. This way we can become a very compatible couple. I am sure our relationship will be very strong and long lasting if we reciprocate the good feelings that we have for each other. 
I respect the idea of a good friend in a husband. I will love it if he becomes a good friend of mine as I will feel more connected to him this way.

I am looking at someone who is based in Mumbai, as I am not looking at relocating to any other part of India at any time in the future. It is okay if your hometown is in some other part of the country, but you should be living in Mumbai.
I am also not looking at relocating to any other country currently","I am looking for a partner who is settled in Mumbai. I would prefer staying separately with my spouse as I am a very independent person and freedom is of utmost importance to me.

My mom is a home maker and taught us how to manage things in life by managing a perfect home. I have grown to become an independent personality through this caring and nurturing family. I always believe in being unique and standing out of the crowd. My early interests in life had been in dance which I didn?t pursue. Learning new things in life is my life?s greatest pursuit which I do till date. That?s the reason for my interest in travelling which never tires me. It revitalizes and rejuvenates me. Travelling around the world is one of my life?s key mottos. I am hoping to accompany a friend and guide in the remaining part of my life?s journey .

"A painter knows how to capture a moment and draw it on a piece of paper in the most beautiful way. I feel that a painter is very lucky because only he can draw his imagination on paper. And I am proud to say that she is a painter and have done many paintings. Since childhood, she was fascinated with the fact that a painter knows how to capture beauty and then make it look more beautiful on paper. When she started painting, she realized that this is true and she can do what she was always fascinated with. she is working in the finance department of an MNC and she enjoy her work a lot. In future, she would like to excel in the same field and I am sure she will achieve what she desire. Though, this does not mean that she is overconfident, but it shows that she is aware of her hard working capability. She look good because people say she has sharp features. Apart from that, she was given the gold award for her performance in her company. They appreciate her work a lot and have told her that a number of times. This boasts her confidence and makes her feel worthy of what she is doing. Though she get very little time to paint because of her busy schedule, but she always make it a point to take out time for painting as this gives her a peace of mind. When she is free, apart from painting, she like to read and watch movies. She also like listening to music. Have a Public School background, Amiable , sweet natured, sharp features, vegetarian , can't cook ""Non-Veg"" meal but have no objection in sharing a same table with non-vegetarians  well versed  in household  affairs.","I want to mention something very specifically that the man I get married to should be from Delhi or NCR. This is because I am well aware of the place and will have no problems in adjusting. Also, my parents live in the same city, so I can meet them if I miss them without travelling a lot. I want to marry a man who is very adjustable and flexible in nature. This is because I donAa?a?t want him to dominate me every time. He should be ready to change himself at times too. I am carrier oriented so I do not want him to ask me to sacrifice my carrier. This will make me very uncomfortable as I love my work and I am appreciated for doing it perfectly. I am sure once he understands me, he will be very proud of the fact that I am good at my work. I have many friends and they all are very close to me. I donAa?a?t want my partner to have a problem with that as I will like to continue my relationship with them. I am sure ones he spends time with them, he will not mind me hanging around with them. I have a traditional outlook towards life, although I donAa?a?t mind accepting some of the modern values. My partner can be either traditional with modern outlook. I have no reservations for that.

"We are straight out of Bride and Prejudice ? a Sikh family, four sisters, a gorgeous mother and, of course, the eternal search for ?suitable boys?. The youngest sisters are twins, and my sister for who we have posted this ad, is one of the twins. 

GROWING UP: Dad served and retired as a Colonel in the Indian Army, and we grew up all over the country ? including big cities like Delhi and Kolkata, and on huge farm houses in smaller cities like Lucknow and Meerut. The summers of our childhood were spent at our grandparents? village ringed by emerald green fields in the Punjab. Or motoring up the highest bridge in the world and picnicking by the Indus in Ladakh. 

She studied at convent schools wherever Dad was posted at the time and then, in Class VIII, the twins went to study in a boarding school in the hills near Chandigarh. They insist they spent the best time of their lives there and frankly speaking, we are all quite jealous of their large, close-knit, persisting circle of friends. 

She studied MBA in Human Resources at an Army institute in that fun student town, Pune. While others partied, my sister worked her ass off. She can be the serious, committed sort. We all believe that the partying would have done her good. 

WORK: The serious, committed, focused person that she is, she has recruited and hired for brand new branches for an MNC bank. We have never seen her at work, but we won?t be surprised if her colleagues call her the Rock. She is currently in Pune working for IBM India.
HER: Of the four sisters, she?s brought home the biggest bonus, she bakes the best cakes, and she has the most beautiful eyes. She is quite boringly untiring about the way she helps her parents; the other twin can be quite a brat. She has bought her mom diamonds, she has let her twin raid her wardrobe. She, frankly speaking, needs to learn how to push back. She could also do better while making life decisions. She is an introvert, an ironing and neat freak","YOU: One school of family thought, which believes in the incredible connection between the twins, says it would be nice for the two to be in the same country. So, we would love to hear from a??suitable boysa?? living in the States. 

Another school of thought says the location does not matter, as long as the guy is a renaissance man, living in one of the big cities in India where my sister can find a job to match her education and experience. 

Either way, we are looking for a man from any religion, state in India. It does not matter whether you are from Kerala or Orissa. You need to have had a good education, you work in the professional services, you have promise and a vision for how you want to shape your career. You believe in yourself, you care for your family, you are liberal, you respect women and their choices. You are prepared to work with my sister on your relationship, you do not already have a mental mould of a partner into which you want to pour my sister into. Lastly, and most importantly, you do not have a temper. 

If you fit the bill, and our sister approves of you, we would love to welcome you in our family..",,32 to 36,30 Dec 1979,06:30:00,India,Jalandhar,Slim,Doesn't Matter,0 brothers ,Sikh - Jat,,Rest of Punjab,"ILS, Pune",Wheatish ,Doesn't Matter,Self,MBA/PGDM,"33 yrs, 5ft 3in,<br />

"Thanks for your time spent in viewing my profile. It could be out of interest or chance. Nevertheless I believe that there is a reason for everything that happens around us. This one is no different!


About Me:

Well, its very difficult to write about oneself... so I will make this very simple.... I am a fun loving and easy going person. I have done my BA in Economics. Have also done my Diploma in Human Resource. Presently working with Capita. I take life as it comes. I value my friends and family.I believe that mutual respect and faith are essential ingredients of happy married life. Its always give and take as it is famously told ""Love is all about sharing and caring"". 

If asked, partner attributes for me would probably range from a honesty to strong family values - - but most of all should respects our traditions, yet have a modern outlook in life.

"What you see is what you get. I am a straight forward, honest, hardworking single woman. I work as a Project Manager in the IT department of my company. When I moved to Boston a couple years ago, I immediately fell in love with the city, its crooked streets and the Charles River. Both Cambridge and Boston remind me very much of my hometown in Mumbai.
Sky Diving has been my most memorable adventure till date and I will soon be going for a flight lesson.
I also enjoy traveling, although it has been very limited lately. Just got back from the Bahamas.
Working out in the gym, attending a Zumba class or practicing Kathak are some of the ways I try to keep myself fit. In the remainder of my spare time I try to catch up on some reading or some good shows on the TV. Presently revisiting Ayn Rand's 'The Fountainhead'.

The other day I was helping my cousin complete a beautiful picture puzzle. We were done with every piece in the right place, but there was crucial piece missing, obviously rendering it incomplete. That's when I realized my life is pretty comparable to that picture puzzle. Now, the question I have for you - are you that missing piece?","Looking for a charming young man, preferrably Hindu and in United States.

I have a supportive and understanding family and I give them the utmost preference in my life. I have a sweet mother who is a teacher by profession and a liberal father who is working as a consultant. I also have a lovely sister who is married and well settled in her married life. 
After completing my school I did my higher education from Delhi University and did BA from there and MA from IGNOU. 
I have very few people who are close to me and they are my best friends. I like to watch movies and travel with them.

Presently I am working as a corporate planner in Unilever, London. In the upcoming time I want to see myself as a successful person and want to make my parents feel proud of me. Every day I work hard with an aim to attain a reputable position in my profession.  
My weakness is that I am very emotional. And my strengths are that I can easily adapt myself according to the situations and I am also a family oriented girl.
I am a homely person and always stay close to my family as I really respect and love them. They are my real support and without them I cannot even think of living my life. My family includes a lovely mother who is a homemaker and has sacrificed a lot for us and a responsible father who has taken retirement from his profession. In addition to this, I have a sister who is a doctor by profession.  
I was a good student of my school and performed well in my class. I have also received many complements from my teachers for this. After completing my school I did PGDBM from Narsimunji, Mumbai.
Friends are always there for us as they laugh with us in our happy times and become one of our biggest supports when we are sad. In my free time I meet up my friends and watch movies with them. I event go to visit different destinations with them. Listening to music refreshes me and gives me time for myself therefore I also love to listen to music.","Marriage is one of the most beautiful relations of all. If you always have your partner with you at all times of joy and sorrow then it is a divine blessing of god. 
I want a person in my life that is simple and decent in nature as well as in his thoughts. He should be family oriented so that when he gets married to me then he should easily mingle with my family. I will reciprocate him positively by accepting his family. 
He should be well educated and must have a decent way of living life. I have no choices in the profession of my husband as he can be from any field. I just want him to be well settled so that after marriage we dona??t struggle to fulfill the basic necessities of our life.  
His family background would be a major concern for my family as it will be significant for them to see me entering a well mannered and decent family. I would prefer a man from India or London. I am ready to get settled with him if he is just the way I want him to be.

"Hi

To begin with, i would like to say that i basically belive, to live and let live others, i like indian culture and our value system especially. the close bonding that we share with our family, here i would like to state that i am blessed to have one such family. My family comprises of Dad, a Central Government Employee, Younger Bro who finished his B. E. and is working &amp; my dad's eldest sis, i. e. my aunt. I lost my mom when i was quite young. I am very attached to my family. My brother being my best critic and i owe all my success to my aunt and dad.

I am very expressive and direct, very sensitive &amp; glad that i am this way, as i am usually liked by everyone for this ( I owe this to my Psychology degree). I tend to give a lot of importance to emotions and the need to express them, i personally feel this was present in the indian culture but we are losing now as all of us are hard pressed for time and getting materialistic. I am very matured by my thinking and prefer others also to be this way.
Oh ya... i am ambitious but not at the cost of losing a family.... so i am highly family based. So i balance between my career and family and expect my man to do the same. I am currently doing my Ph. D in management.
Looking out for a person who is also equally sensitive and expressive of emotions, who tends to value the importance of others emotions even if he does not necessarily agree with it. He should be sensibile and oriented to the needs of family, should be achievement oriented but have the morals not to stamp on to others shoes to be successful. It would be great if he too has a blend of likingness for Indian culture and traditions and the modern views.
I would expect him to move into my family and be a part of my family and not just in my life, i vow to be the same towards him. I basically aim at two families getting together and not just two individuals.
I have a mental block towards alcohol and smoking so prefer my man not have those habits.","Looking out for a person who is also equally sensitive and expressive of emotions, who tends to value the importance of others emotions even if he does not necessarily agree with it.

"I am an independent, fun loving and ambitious woman. I am hardworking and I believe in constantly raising the bar, both in the quality of work I do and the quality of life I lead. But at the same time I must confess that I am also a little laid back at times. I am at present employed as a training manager in the HR department of an MNC and I work on leadership development, organisation development and behavioural training programs. 

I am a humanitarian and social issues concerning under priviledged women and children, appeal to me, and I plan to actively get involved in humanitarian activities.

I love spending an evening of music and dance with friends whenever I have the time though it rarely happens these days owing to the long work hours that we all maintain. My other interests are travelling and reading. I have to..have to go around the world and I am sure i wouldn't be able to do that in 80 days given my love for knowing new people and places, their lifestyle etc. I could actually spend years going around the world! Had I not been working as a trainer, I would have probably been a host on a travel show! So is my love for visiting new places.","I would love to be with a person who has the drive to achieve but at the same time, takes out time to enjoy life. Who would share my zest for life and would be equally thrilled by the spectacular world around us! There are so many beautiful places to visit and so many things to discover on this beautiful planet of ours!!",,,29 Jan 1980,,India,,Average,,,Bengali,,,,Fair ,,Self,B.Sc (Science),"33 yrs, 5ft 2in,<br />

"A Libran born at 12.30 pm on 28th September, 1980,  in a Brahmin family in Bhagalpur. We belong to ""Bhardwaj Gotraa"". I am 5.3 tall and weigh 50 kg.

My early childhood was spent in Assam. Schooling in St. Stephens, Tinsukia, SSPM Chiplun and Bhawans School, Bharuch.
Graduation took me to BMCC; Pune where I did commerce and then further pursued Post Graduation Diploma in Management from IIMM [2003].  First job and financial freedom came with Tata Infomedia where I worked for about a year. Better career prospects made me shift to ICICI Prudential where I spent four years making my way to Sales Manager. Next jump and promotion came with my joining Bajaj Allianz in October, '08. This is a challenging job and my responsibility as Regional Manager spans across the country with base in Mumbai. I do travel to various cities at least twice a month.
I quite enjoy my present job but would like to be in the financial sector in the years ahead. My total financial remunerations adds to six digit in a year.

Though working in Mumbai is hectic I do find time to indulge in weekend outing with family and long long drives. Reading preference is eclectic, inspirational and self motivating text being the current flavor. Good movies, music, both film and Indian classical is top on my activity list. Games, adventure sports and travel to exotic places is on my wish list. I value my family and am proud of our culture and traditions. Firmly believe in marriage and permanent relationships, and would happily give away all for a happy home and family.  Natural surrounding, company of people with substance and indulgence in activities where I can contribute as a person is what I cherish and long for.

My family consists of my parents and one sister and a brother. Sister is elder, engaged and working as a HR Manager in Patni Computers. Younger brother, a management post graduate has started his career with Ballarpur Industries, Delhi.  My father is a Chartered Accountant and is with Indorama Cements, Mumbai. His earlier jobs took us to Assam, Orissa, Gujarat and finally Maharashtra, where we now have a permanent base in Panvel [Mumbai]. Our ancestral home is in Rajasthan, though my grand parents lived in Bhagalpur. My mother's family is mostly settled in Assam. My mother is our anchor and support and maintains a cozy, warm and loving home.","I am looking for a life partner. A man of compassion and caliber.
One who is skilled and able to steer our ship through choppy waters and adventures enough to explore newer horizons. A person I can proudly look up to and support with my heart and soul, one for whom family is sacrosanct and parents divine. A heart which feels for the less privileged, has the time to extend a helping hand and has a song and smile on his face. A sense of humor that can keep me amused a life time.

"First, the cliches (i mean... who would say bad things about themselves anyway?).... Happy, calm, focused, trusting, fun-loving (if you cant laugh... then whats the point?), extroverted, love nature, hate concrete, need some 'alone-time' occasionally, structured, adaptable, curious... Things that are close to my heart are family, honesty (esp. to yourself about your own vulnerabilities), happiness, being spiritual and being ""into"" life - both the ups and the downs. ... what i believe now after seeing hard times is "" what's the use of worrying?? it never was worthwhile, so pack your troubles in your kit-bag and smile, smile and smile""

Note:- I'm currently in United States for vacations till August 2011.","i looking for
someone who I can share my life with. That means love, fun, sharing solem moments, teasing, fighting (of course, i expect to lose) - really just someone with whom I can grow and share everything thats in my heart without giving a second thought... someone who not only understands my words but my silence... I'm definitely looking for someone who can talk to me about anything, someone that I can have long conversations with about both important and meaningless things, someone who approaches life with an unspoken grace and a gentle optimism yet knows that the road can be hard and tough. I`m looking for a best friend who I can really be there for throughout the good times and the bad. Oh, and someone to watch the sunsets with... But hey, chemistry and that special ""x-factor"" are really hard to quantify in a few words (or even in a few thousand) and don't even come close to describing the depths and intricacies of who someone really is... 
 so if u r smiling hit the contact button and make a friend 
Otherwise  best of luck to everyone that pursues their dreams in life without endangering the dreams of others

Having been brought up in a liberal atmosphere, she has grown into being a person who firmly believes in herself and walks into all phases of life with equal ease. She did her schooling from DPS, R K Puram &amp; completed her post graduation in Food Technology (with gold medal). Was selected on campus from SBI for Agr-business Marketing which she eventually left to pursue a career in the Food industry. At present she is an Account Manager-National for Dow Chemical's Food Ingredients business in Mumbai. Since her childhood days she has been an extrovert kind of person who, if she wants, can make friends with 8 yr to 80 yr old with same amount of enthusiasm, and be equally compassionate to both. Has always been among the 1st 4 ranker in school and topped her universities in grads and post graduates. Being the youngest of all in her company, she is not only adored extremely among her co-workers but also very fondly treated by her seniors as well due to the kind of sincerity she puts into her job. On holidays, she goes out with us, her friends and at times simply stays at home reading books, watching TV or painting. She is not a regular cook but occasionally she makes these full course meals, which i must say she makes even better than her mom.

"Hello I am a God fearing person and spiritual. I believe nothing happens without His blessings. I feel at the end of the day it is important to be happy from within. I believe in giving happiness to people around me. I feel carrying on grievances and hurt is wasting energy in life. 

I love to be active, do well for everyone around me in whatever ways I can. I would love to have a partner who would believe in the same and would extend his kind support in the worst of times. 

I believe strongly in a few things; they are IF YOU REST YOU RUST, ALL THAT IS BEAUTIFUL MAY NOT BE GOOD, BUT ALL THAT IS GOOD IS ALWAYS BEAUTIFUL. IF YOU ARE UNHAPPY, IT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE ORGANIZED YOURSELF FOR THE SAME. NO ONE MAKES YOU UNHAPPY. I AM THE PERSON WHO WOULD ALWAYS SEARCH FOR THE OPEN DOORS AND NOT BANG ON THE CLOSED DOORS IN LIFE AND BLEED. 





I am a very frank person; believe in doing things on time, very punctual. And I take life as it comes by. No anxieties of the past and no anxieties of the future either, make me live happy in PRESENT. I am a very open person, who would consider everybody's opinion and believe in respecting the individuality in each one. 

I wish to balance my family and professional life in a harmonious way. I wish to give an equal weight age to both my family and profession. And yes as far as ambitions go, well I would ascertain myself globally in the field I shall pursue. But again striking a fine balance with family and career.    

I love kids. I feel they make living worthwhile. I believe in loyalty, honesty and self effort. I wish to pursue my further study in Neurology as I feel it is a very fascinating subject. I love traveling, listening to music, meeting new people, learning new things. 

I vow to be fully supportive to Him in all matters. I would love to have medico/non medico, no particular preference but yes I would wish to have someone who has really seen life in its all forms, who is not very judgmental, sensitive to others, supportive and believe in A?WEA? as I said earlier.",,I am the only child.My father is a doctor..a practicing anaesthetist and mother has done MSC in pharmacology and is a housewife.  ,27 to 33,29 May 1980,,India,Jamnagar,Athletic,Athletic,,Lohana,,,,Fair ,Doesn't Matter,Self,MD/ MS (Medicine),"33 yrs, 5ft 5in,<br />
