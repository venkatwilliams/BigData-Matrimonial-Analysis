She has a balanced outlook and wide ranging interests. 

She completed her education which got interrupted by her marriage and is preparing herself to stand on her feet and take good care of her child. The Lecturer ship is a step in this direction.

She comes from a well educated, well placed family based in Kolkata. We are settled in Pune.

"There are many people on earth who make anything they do the best. They just light up the place where they are. Their company seems the best to people. I am proud to say that I have that quality. I am not boasting but my presence lights up the group I am in. I have always had this quality. Since childhood, people have been telling me about this. My charisma is one of the best things I have. This has helped me make many friends. I not only feel proud but also happy that I have something that attracts people towards me. Apart from that, an interest in languages brought up by the fluency. A simple hard work in understanding the day to day practice gave me a much better confidence in my personality. I feel happy that I got what I aimed for. My way of talking has helped me boost my professional and personal vitae and gave me something to look forward that is to learn another language- French. We belong to a very respectable family from Delhi. Ours is a very simple, cultured and educated family with good and strong moral values. The upbringing in the family teaches respect both towards younger and older personal, family values and an honest lifestyle with a perspective towards new ideas with an open-minded viewpoint. Professionally, I am into software technology at managerial position. My work gives me a lot of pleasure and I feel I am worth a lot because of that. In future, I want to excel in the same field and grow professionally. I love reading. I think it is a nice way to learn. A passion which I inherited from my mother is cooking. I love trying different types of cuisine. A vegetarian by choice, I like creating continental dishes. An interest in simple things in life like art, handicraft and theater is something I cherish and works as a stress buster.","I have been brought up in a nuclear family with a small close knit affair. I am looking for a respectable nuclear family with simple and good moral values. Family and education are very important in life. I think the man I want to get married should be educated as its the asset one has, which he will always cherish for the entire lifetime. I belong to a simple and well settled family. I would like my partner to be very well settled and his family too. He should have a confident personality and a good sense of humor. People can easily count on me as I am very supportive. I always appreciate truthfulness and honesty. ","We belong to a very respectable family Delhi. Ours is a very simple, cultured and educated family with good and strong moral values.

"I believe that a simple life is best for everyone as it guides you to eliminate the unnecessary things from your life. I portray myself as a simple and a sober person who simplifies everything in order to avoid the complexities of life. By profession I am a CA and currently I am running a CA practicing firm. I am very serious about my work and work hard to achieve the top position. I do my work with complete loyalty and dedication. I am very close to my family and care a lot about them. My mother is a housewife and father is a Sr. Manager of a reputed Engineering firm. After my school education, I completed my B Sc (Honors) from Calcutta University and CA Certificate. Whenever I get time from work I like to do the household works and cook. I also like to drive, listen to music and read novels. I have very few friends and like to spend most of my time with them. My nature is that of a very caring person and I care about my friends a lot.","Like every girl even I have some desires regarding my life partner. Most importantly he should be a nice human being. I have no problems in marrying a person from any profession. He should be well settled so that he can take care of me properly. 
I want my life partner to be well educated and qualified so that he can understand my perspective towards life. Every parent wants their girl to be married in a good family so as mine. My husband should come from a good family background and they must have a decent image in the society. 
According to me a there should be transparency between a couple and I want my husband to be honest with me. This way we can avoid unnecessary misunderstandings between us. He should give sheer importance to elders and must respect them. This way I will be able to respect him as well as his family and the elderly members. 
My major weakness is that I am very emotional so I want my life partner to know about it. He should take care of this fact. I want him to understand me and make me strong enough to face the world. If he is like this then I will give him all my love.

We are one music loving family  that simply loves to travel.

"Hi, 

I am basically a middle mgmt professional and looking for a friend for life time. I consider myself as a self respecting and understanding lady and looking for similar profile to match. I am career oriented but at the same time not too ambitious in my life. I believe everything happens at its own pace. I need a companion who is fun to be with and knows what he wants in his life. Personal space in my opinion is required for everyone of us. 

I am not a very traditional girl but at the same time not so modern. I respect the culture &amp;  traditions but choose not to follow them rigidly. I consider these are based on the personal choice of an individual or a couple. 

In my life, my parents and my friends are very much important. I have two elder sisters and they are also like my friends. I am looking for my soul mate through this website. If you think you are the one whom I am looking for, let us share our ideas.","Frequency match is really important for me. Looking for someone who can relate to me, fun to be with.. If you think you are also looking for someone like this, please initiate the contact..
