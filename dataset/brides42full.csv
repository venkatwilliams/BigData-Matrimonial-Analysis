"People are always shocked when I say I've been in the USA since I was 6 months old because I can speak Gujarati fluently and I am traditional when it comes to family values and loyalty.

I am fun and very relaxed and easy going.  Even though I am very very successful in my career, I am humble.  By just talking with me, you would not think I have accomplished all that I have so far.

Growing up was very difficult for me and my family.  We struggled for money and I have watched my parents work really hard to maintain our home.  With those experiences, I have a hard work ethic and a strong belief in family. I learned to find joy and entertainment in the simplicity of life and friends and family.

I'm pretty lighthearted.  I laugh and smile a lot; I know who I am as a person.  I know my strengths, what I am capable of doing and I also know I have weaknesses.

For fun, I love to spend summers at the beach.  I enjoy parasailing, riding a bike on the boardwalk and cooking.

I love movies, especially romantic comedies.  In many ways, I am a dreamer and a romantic.  I'm hoping to find a strong man, someone who will hold my hand and be my rock and someone who is ambitious. I want someone who enjoys going out on weekends but doesnt mind staying home either.  I'm looking for a serious relationship, one that will lead to marriage.

I know that being on these sites is difficult and sometimes frustrating.  I'm just hoping to find the one that makes it all worth the effort.

"I feel pleasure in sharing my precious time only with myself. Hence I submit all my thought to myself only. I am a best friend of my own. Being shy in nature I am not much comfortable with people and keep distance from them. 
Usually thoughts vary according to ones personality and sometimes it influences othersAA?A?. ThatAA?A?s why I donAA?A?t like to disclose my opinion in front of others. Some circumstances in my past life have made me less social. 
Self dependent and being a teacher I have to handle different types of problems in my profession, perhaps this is the one of the reason I have now gained expertise in handling difficult situations. 
Life AA?A? is game of pain and pleasure. Suffering became my master and taught me AA?A? courage, persistence and patience. I believe in the power of God as he has blessed me all those strength that I need to overcome the challenges of life. In spite of that I see- life is beautiful! 
I am religious. All road leads to one God and I truly believe that the best service to God is to serve humanity. 
I am a very simple and a sober girl with adjustable nature and have my full devotion to my work and family at same time. After my job and house hold chores I like reading article and books. Sometimes my school work also keeps me busy. When I have time I spend it with my Mother as she watched her favorite shows on television. 
In my career I do not have high hopes and ambitions; I work hard to get hike and growth in profile in my near future. Apart from all these I want to pursue MBA to get higher professional education.","In Indian society marriage is a necessity of life to give a new exposure of life style, new thoughts and new purpose for ones living. 
Marriage is a junction where trains of two different personalities arrive and start new journey. I think both have equal roles to build up the foundation of marriage and to maintain its harmony, sanctity, and purity as well.
 My past does not approve or permit me to draw any picture of my dream partner. But still my heart is always searching for that someone with whom I can spend my whole life together with love, peace and happiness.
 I do not have any specific expectation from my life partner. Being a girl from next door my thoughts can match with anyone who would have great understanding of my views and circumstances. 
The person who will be ready to accept me with my past and as I am. Any profession will be acceptable but I would not appreciate or be supportive of smoking and drinking.

"As-Salaam-Alaikum,

I believe a healthy marital relationship is based upon Fear of ALLAH, mutual trust and simplicity. What I look for in a partner is the above. We all have our goods and not so good sides but a little bit of understanding and tolerance goes into building a happy &amp; strong marriage. I understand the give and take premise too and that starts within oneself.

I am looking for a good Muslim partner; not someone who just wants a wife for a particular reason. Basically, an educated (not necessarily academically), self sufficient individual with a respectable family background.","A little about me:
I was rushed into my first marriage. It was ALLAH's will that it lasted for just a couple of years. I have since then devoted my life to my daughter to ensure her upbringing, needs and care taking are intact. I am tall, fair, educated and religious woman. Being forthcoming goes a long way with me. I live with my mother and brothers in U.A.E. Looking forward to hearing from people alike.

"My sister is a person who looks for a practical end result which is tangible and long lasting. High flying, fanciful notions don't interest her. She is placid, reliable, consistent, she may look easy going and laid back but she likes to be in control in her life and relationships. 
She much prefer a routine which she can see stretching ahead. A marathon runner not a sprinter, she has staying power and the will to see projects through to the end. A settled home and family life is very important to her emotional happiness. She is protective to the point of possessiveness of those close and will defend them vigorously against anyone who threatens them in any way. Nothing pleases her more than a house full of the extended family and close friends, enjoying themselves. 

Loyalty is a strong factor in her thinking where life partners are concerned. Once established in a long running relationship she is happy for it to continue on an even course. Beauty, elegance and indulgence make her purr with pleasure. An perfectionist about prospective partners, like them to be well turned out. 
 A nature lover, she adore the wide open spaces, she also appreciate the cultural highlights which big cities offer. Places close to normal residence make her feel at ease so she often doesn't have to travel far to relax. 

At home a mix of elegance and pleasurable comfort is the look she aims for. Though she'll never let design get in the way of practicality. 
For her, home needs to be functional as well as beautiful.",,,,03 May 1971,,India,Raipur,Athletic,,,Maratha,,,,Fair ,,Sister,B.Com (Commerce),"42 yrs, 5ft 4in,<br />

"Thank you for taking time out to look at my details.  I am working with a very reputed concern in Mumbai for last 12 years. I am very simple, loyal, homely, understanding and caring person with an adjustable nature.  I am seeking a match, with similar characteristics.  I am not afraid to make a commitment and seeking a loving, lasting and 100% relationship as that is what I offer! Promise to always be a best friend as can be counted on.    I consider myself as a sensitive and down to earth person who believes in values of life. I am intelligent, cultured, well spoken, with a pleasant personality.  I have respect for elders, love for younger, care and concern for all near and dear ones as which is part of my nature.   Marriage to me would be a life time union between two like minded people who are refreshingly different in their own ways. The twosome, who could spend time in compatible silence or do many different things together, yet offer each other enough space to be their own person. Two people being able to share their innermost feelings and thoughts, without fear of being judged. I am seeking a simple person who is willing to stand shoulder to shoulder, whether it is rain or shine! And if understanding is there, we can conquer the world together.
