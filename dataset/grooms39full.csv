"A very simple, sensible and straightforward person: I admire innocence and direct approach. People who play games are out of my league. I believe that there would be much less hurt and pain if people had transparency in their words, actions and behaviors. Very Honest: I don't say things that I don?t mean and I respect those who are determined to be honest, no matter what they have to go through. Ambitious yet Practical: I have my goals, interests and desires but my priorities are straight and I am clear about when and where to draw the line. Sensitive and Caring: People's feelings are my utmost concern. I care a lot for people I love and could do anything to bring them little reasons to smile. Kindhearted and generous: Perhaps this holds true for most people- I feel most contended if I have made someones day. Religious but not superstitious. Motivated to make the most out of this beautiful Life that we are blessed with. Having someone to hold hands with as I tread along this path could make it an ever-cherished experience, I believe.

"I am quite straightforward by nature and prefer my partner to be so too. I love to read, go on hikes and treks or just out to the beach. I maintain that its not the place but the person you are with that matters for having fun. I am looking for someone to really give love who can be kind and would love to share her life with me.  I love to go on treks or outings, though I have not had much of a chance in the past. If you are ambitious, I like that, for I am happiest when I am helping you achieve your goals.  I believe in both of us helping each other to greater heights. I have a 9 yr old daughter who lives with me; and we are looking for someone to receive all the love we are capable of giving. I am a bit of a romantic, so be prepared to be serenaded with old Hindi songs etc.  I am religious, so I go to the temple every week. I believe it keeps me grounded and allows me to humble and keep my life straight. I don't cook much, so it would be nice if my future partner were a good cook. I am of course an excellent sous chef. I was brought up in Mumbai, hence my outlook might be more cosmopolitan than you expect. I spent the last 12 years in the US as an IT professional. Currently I am back in Mumbai and working again.",I'd like to marry someone whom I can fall in love with.

"I love to write, but its a daunting task to sum up myself (or anybody, for that matter) in a boxed space! And well, I am not a writer by profession. But I am charmed by artful expression and eloquent prose. I edit a newsletter, and write in my free time. In college I had my fair share of public speaking experiences.
The basics about me - I worked till recently for the strategy consulting major Booz Allen Hamilton based out of Chicago. I am currently a senior manager with Wal-Mart in its corporate strategy group. Before leaving for the US for business school, I worked for six years with India's leading automotive manufacturer at Delhi and Kolkata. 

I am cheerful, vibrant; I love life and laughter - a definite optimist. Classmates described me as: Very genuine, intelligent- intellectually and emotionally, honest and considerate about others, has a strong sense of values and is willing to stand up for what he believes in, creative, willing to sacrifice for others, exudes decency, strives to build relationships. Ok, all this sounds extraordinarily pompous, so I will let it be. :-)

But seriously, I am under no illusion of being picture perfect (pun intended). And I would be equally happy to acquaint you with my negatives. The only reason I wrote out the above is to highlight what I would love to see in you. More importantly, I am looking for someone who truly respects herself. Someone who is confident, knows her own mind and yet secure enough to remain kind. I would love it if you radiate a healthy, positive attitude - are someone ready to share a silly joke and a hearty laugh. Like they say - dissimilarities attract, but similarity is the glue that keeps couples together through the rough and tumble of life. 

I do take out time to pursue my passions and have fun! My interests comprise doing pro bono social work, public speaking, reading, cooking, yoga, writing, understanding people and cultures, and a variety of sports. I am enthusiastic about learning dance, and have been regular at the gym for a while now. 

Oh, and I haven't answered the geography question for myself yet. The right person will have a huge say on whether its back to India or the US for me. 

Looking ahead, life seems to hold so much on offer and there is so much more to learn. I am fascinated already by the journey ahead. A path that can become more fulfilling and fun with a soul mate. Would love to hear if you have similar thoughts.

I grew up in a very warm and loving family. As an Army officer's kid, I guess I was exposed to a variety of places, people and experiences during my childhood. My father has since retired as a Brigadier, and is based at Noida near Delhi.

Other areas of ministry include, health &amp; wellness and Humanitarian aids. I am studious, well organized, financially very sound and have been a leader with good people skills. Other than gifts of ministry, am a man of love and compassion.",,My Parents are believers and love the Lord. They are both retired from banking services and serve the Lord in the ministry. My elder brother is married and is in ministry.

"I come across as a cheerful and bubbly individual - natural for someone who loves compassionate. I come from liberally thinking family where everyone is educated and have very good understanding. Decisions are taken practically and collectively. Anytime in need, everyone is approachable. At times, I have been impulsive. My Mom is true critic of my personal lifestyles and pampers me a lot.
Apart from few ground-rooted values, I'm not rigid in my outlook towards people/places /situations and believe in looking for the 'good' in people. This has proven helpful in adapting to new people and a lot of idea-exchanging/mingling with people (friends/colleagues). Perhaps that is why I am easily adaptable to new situations. I had an opportunity to work with company/clients having global presence and have also travelled to US.
My friends/colleagues describe me as hard-working, enthusiastic, patient, honeyed and intelligent having good analytical skills.
In my spare time, I like to browse the net. I would enjoy chilling with a book. Music keeps me going anytime, anywhere.","I am looking for a partner who is confident, educated and believes in Jain values. She should also be social and fun-loving. I believe these qualities will ensure we are able to grow together in all walks of life, be it personal, professional, social and family life. According to me, Trust is very essential in building everlasting relationship. Companionship is about being able to fill up for your partner's weaknesses. Also, enhance and support her/his strengths.

"I consider myself a world citizen and is respectful of all cultures. My travel and work have exposed me to the global market and its fascinating how humanity functions in different markets in different geographies. I have an MBA in marketing and a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry. I am currently working as a strategy director specializing in brand and business planning. I have sauntered through three continents and 35 countries over the past 15 years working on some challenging assignments that stimulated the brain cells, and made me more appreciative of different cultures and customs. My work and travel has made me richer (not in the wallet) by exposing me to the myriad world of consumerism across industries. I finally decided to follow a more salubrious work regimen and have settled in Toronto and deal with clients in US, Canada and Asia. My friends describe me as vivacious, quick witted and smart and sometimes nutty. Values are honesty, integrity and above all commitment. Motto in life is that impossible is nothing.

"Hey, I m Indrajit hear.Managing Director.SLIEVERS AGRI BIOTECH. I do some travelling first. Planning on spending this December in America ..so you can make your own conclusion :)
I am passionate about learning, about sharing new ideas, about traveling to new places, about being an independent and empowered man, but I also long to meet a loving companion, to build a family and to share my destiny. I want to love and be loved, to touch and be touched, and to move beyond myself, to share a wonderful life with the right woman. The most important quality should be intelligence. I want to know someone who will be my full partner in living and learning. Yet intelligence must come with compassion and a loving heart. She is also an outdoorswoman who is hooked on pop culture and isn't afraid to cry during sappy movies. For me integrity, self discipline, and diligence are the keys to a healthy life. Life is a journey, it is not a destination. Life is neither easy nor fair. One must be strong minded. I enjoy everyday life, and take responsibility for everything I do. A person must be ready to compromise when seeking a happy marriage. It requires that one take a risk. I have reached the point in my life when I want to take that risk. I am at an independent, attractive, well educated Man. I am ready to meet and engage the right Woman. I am out going and approachable, but I am also reserved and traditional. Are you ready for this? Let journey begin","
About My Partner 
She should be a friend easy to talk to about anything and everything. Should be able to take on responsibilities , a matured individual , with a focused thought process .Negative Egostist attitude is a complete NO . Should be fun loving, would be able to accept me with my positive waves and negative waves. Career , ambitions , professionalism should not overshadow family , togetherness , warmth and peace of mind.
I know nobody is perfect , neither am I , nor I want a perfect Woman , I wish to share and live , enjoy each others company for the rest of my life with a lot of positive warmth , love , and peace of mind.",,,06 Aug 1974,01:02:00,India,Aizwal,Average,Average,,Brahmin - Bengali,Bengali,,,Very Fair ,Very Fair,Self,MBA/PGDM,"39 yrs, 5ft 7in,<br />

"It is a daunting task to sum up oneself (or anybody, for that matter) in a boxed space! The basics about me - I am currently in India having just graduated from a top-tier business school in the US. I am working for the strategy consulting major Booz Allen Hamilton in Chicago. Before leaving for the US,I worked for Maruti Udyog in Dealer Development, Market Strategy and Sales (1996-02, Delhi and Kolkata). 

I am an optimist, a cheerful and vibrant guy - and I love to laugh. I strive to live life to its fullest. During one of my business school courses, classmates described me as: Very genuine, intelligent- intellectually and emotionally, honest but also very considerate about others, has a strong sense of values and is willing to stand up for what he believes in, extremely creative, unselfish, willing to sacrifice for others, flexible and able to accommodate other viewpoints, extremely well-mannered, exudes decency, strives to build relationships and understand others. At this point, I think this list sounds seriously pompous, so I will let it be. :-)

The only reason I wrote out the above list of qualities is to highlight what I would also love to see in my partner. She must be somebody who respects herself. Someone who is confident, yet kind and compassionate. Someone who radiates a healthy, positive attitude and a delicious sense of humour. While dissimilarities attract, research says the similarity between couples is the glue that keeps them together through the rough and tumble of life. 

My interests comprise doing pro bono social work, public speaking, reading, cooking, yoga, writing, understanding people and cultures, and a variety of sports. I have been regular at the gym for a while now. I am on a mission to learn golf during this vacation (ok, that was overstating it :-) - but I am going to take a shot at learning the basics). 

I grew up in a very warm and loving family. As an Army officer's kid, I guess I was exposed to a variety of places, people and experiences during my childhood. My father has since retired as a Brigadier. I have two elder brothers who are officers in the Indian Army and Navy respectively.

I believe it important to keep growing as a person throughout life. I carry a spiritual understanding of human life and of the world we live in. A couple genuinely in love would feel free to truly discover and be their own selves in their marriage. 

At this point in life, if I look back I feel I have travelled quite a distance. But looking ahead, I realize life has so much more to offer and there is so much more to learn. I am sure a fascinating journey lies ahead. It is a journey that each of us can make infinitely richer and more fulfilling with a soul mate and life partner. I would love to hear from you if you have similar thoughts.",Check my profile for details on this.,,29 to 34,21 Jul 1974,,India,,Slim,Slim,,Kshatriya,,,,Wheatish ,Doesn't Matter,Self,MBA/PGDM,"39 yrs, 5ft 8in,<br />

"I am a highly educated, talented, ambitious, open-minded, affectionate, sensitive, simple and well cultured person. Looking for my soul-mate who is also having the same qualities from the Lingayat community or from any other caste....... 
Being an artist, musician, poet and a writer I taught in some of the well known and prestigious colleges for 8-9 years. Now I have been teaching Indian classical music.
As a person of ideals, I hate and oppose the evils of our social system like casteism, dowry, etc.....   Marriage, as I feel, should not just be a relation, but the meeting of two intellects, rationale, talents and pure hearts...   As I am having such qualities in me, naturally and necessarily I expect all these qualities from the girl who is going to be my soul-mate; I expect all these because, I do not like the woman just as a domestic worker and a pleasure partner of somebody, as she has been considered and treated throughout our history and present. I expect my would-be wife to be of that height of my level by means of intellect, talent, knowledge, pure heart, and virtue. I strongly believe and hold this view, and I say these only are the true riches we as parents can pass on to our children and future generation through our genes. I expect the girl (preferably working in govt. or private) who meets all these qualities. 
.... I live an intellectual life, who consider the life without a higher &amp; noble goal to achieve and intellectualism is just waste.... by this, please don't think that, I am under estimating or disrespecting the common people, for whom actually I have a lot of respect which they deserve naturally. What I am trying to emphasize or convince is the animals which are born in the form of HUMAN should live, behave, act and THINK like HUMAN... and must be HUMANE! 
People in this state know me very well as a progressive thinker and writer. Thousands of students study my writings as the text as a part of their syllabus in colleges, and many esteemed magazines and publications have published many of my articles.
I expect a girl with such qualities and abilities, who is really INTELLECTUAL, TALENTED, and HUMANE &amp; KIND HEARTED, who will be a venerable goddess and rule my heart...!!!","I expect my would be wife to be of that hight of my level by means of intellect, talent, knowledge, pure heart, and virtue.

"Well heres a rundown about myself..I would say that Im a strong willed person who likes to live life passionately and intensely cause I enjoy the feeling of living at full capacity, discovering new worlds and usually taking the untried path rather than the safe, reliable ones as im quite the gambler and adventurer at heart.
Im an intensely involved person and usually jealously attached to whatever I care about.
I display a quiet exterior but beneath lies a great deal of emotional depth, sensitivity, complexity and a fierce determination.

Usually an incurable optimist, a big dreamer I have a great deal of trust in life and a sporting, playful attitude toward life.

I enjoy camaradarie and thrive in the company of fun loving people with a zest for life.
A bit on the poetic/mystical side of life I have a great love for music, travel and a nature lover attracted to artistic and creative pursuits.

I value luxury, comfort and elegance very highly and appreciate beautiful things.","My ideal partner must be someone who can make me smile, is passionate and spontaneous.

"I'm a friendly, down to earth, caring, social person with a balanced perspective towards life with a mix of traditional and cultural values and a progressive modern attitude.

I?ve been born and brought up in Mumbai where I spent first 18 years of my life after which I?ve been in different places either for education or work. Though my undergraduate degree was in engineering my interest in design made me pursue two masters in Industrial Design (one in India and the other one in the U. S. ). I worked for a brief period in the U.S.and returned to India in 2010.

My interests in life are quite varied and I enjoy a broad spectrum of things be it different genre of music, movies or books, depending on my mood ? but humor is one thing I always appreciate. I like art in most forms. 

Not a big sports fan but whenever I do watch a game I prefer watching fast paced games like soccer and basket ball and like playing ping- pong/table tennis. 

I love the outdoors and trying new restaurants and different cuisines? love travelling (have travelled a bit in India as well as in the west and a few of road trips in the U. S. ). I?m always open to positive influences in life and always open to try out new things at least once. 

I appreciate genuineness in a person and I'm looking for a person who would be my companion and a friend, an equal partner... who is genuinely warm-hearted, social and has a positive outlook towards life and complements me... and is willing to stay committed through ups and downs in life... 

I feel no one is perfect and all individuals are unique in their own way and what matters in a relationship is the chemistry between the two individuals and how good they are together.

"Simplicity helps in avoiding the complexities and problems of life.  
I describe myself as a simple and decent person who is flexible and easily adjusting in any situation of life. Further, I like to spend most of my time listening to music, reading books, travelling to new places and watching movies.   
In my professional life I am working as a Cashier with Sudarshan Silks. I am a dedicated worker. Due to my dedication I have received a lot of  appreciation. I want to see myself growing and reaching a reputed position in life. 
My mother is a homemaker and father is a retired Custom Officer. I have a sister who is currently married and a brother who is running a business of his own.  
My school life was pretty smooth and I was a good student. After completing my school education I completed B Com from Bangalore University.
Friends play a major role in my life. I have few friends in my life who are very close to my heart. I can share my feelings and emotions with them only.","I want my life partner to be simple and well qualified with a positive attitude towards life. She should come from a good family background, having a decent image in the society. Further, I would prefer a girl from Delhi/NCR region. 
She will have the freedom to choose whether she would like to work or stay at home. It will be completely her decision to choose her profession. I would appreciate if she works as it will help her create her own identity and confidence. 
I would prefer a girl from Karnataka who is well settled in her life. One of the important features I want in my wife is that she should not only respect me but my family also. This way she will gain a lot of respect and love in my eyes. 
If she is the way I am looking for then she will get a lot of love from me.

I find comfort in simplicity of things. I am sensitive,
very caring, 
down to earth person. I am very adjustable &amp; take life
as it comes. 

Professionally I am involved in dual roles. I work in a
reputed company 
as a zonal head and also have a small venture of my
own having an annual turn over of around 4-5 cr. By Gods
grace I'm very 
well to do, but however there is still a void in my
life which I think I should fill again.

I was married once before but due to reasons beyond human
control our 
marriage was over. My wife passed away.. 

Life is unpredictable &amp; I try my best to live to
fullest everyday.I am a 
fun loving person who believes that if you wait for
happiness it will 
never come. Happiness is all around you,
n chirping of the birds, to the morning sunrise, to the
sound of the 
waves clashing on the beach.

Looking for someone who can understand me, consider my
parents as her 
own &amp; I can do the same for her.
If you feel we have something in common, please get in
touch with me.

think likewise only then get in touch..Good Luck!!]","Some one who is honest &amp;  caring, loving children &amp;  who cares about relations &amp;  commitments.

"Beaches, Music &amp; Driving soothe me. A self made individual, I have my own style. Its easy to mistake pride vs arrogance. I am proud to have achieved whatever I have till now in my career and personal life and am also ambitious enough to pursue further. When I say ""ambitious enough"" I mean that for me a thorough work - life balance is very important. 
I am kinda offbeat when I say that weekends see me doing my household chores but that does not stop me from catching up with friends, movies, a long drive or just hanging and chilling out.
Passionate conversations over coffee with my partner, add a little twist of romance &amp; humor, double it up with a good dinner n dance, is something I have been wanting and see myself happy with. Having few friends who I can vouch for I want someone who understands those bonds and treasures them the way I do.
Experiences have helped me evolve into a hearty disposition with a great deal of self assurance and confidence. At the same time it has taught me how important individuality and space is.
There is a lot more to write but I believe its the best when you hear it face to face rather than depend on glorified writings at times......more when we meet.","I am looking for a partner who can challenge my thirst for adventure, surprise me with spontaneity, has an individuality of her own when it comes to her career (if working) and way of doing things. Someone who will help me balance my life even better. Space is something I highly respect and expect the same from my better half; and it goes both ways.
Love is the best when it is both ways. Having said that, I think every person is different, a lot of the other things can be worked upon. If we click together it is all the more worthwhile to change or tweak ourselves a bit for each other.
I have been waiting for my gurl for such a long time, I hope that she comes soon else I may have to dissappear in the wilderness :-)",,29 to 33,01 Jan 1974,09:10:00,India,Mumbai,Athletic,Athletic,,Others,,,,Fair ,Fair,Self,Masters,"39 yrs, 5ft 8in,<br />

"I am a single, never married, soft-spoken person who is polite with everyone and is very respectful of the views of others. I have been brought up with a mix of Indian traditions and modern liberal values. I am also a person with a very positive attitude and a lot of enthusiasm &amp; zest for life. I always sees the glass ""Half-Full"" and not ""Half-Empty"". 

I believe strongly in sharing all the responsibilities with my future bride equally and will also give her the space and support she needs to develop her potential fully. 

I am a fair, slim, tall and handsome person according to my parents and friends. I speak Dutch and English fluently  and understand Tamil reasonably well. I also understand &amp; speak German reasonably well.

I have completed my education in Accounting and am employed for several years as an Accounting and Administration professional. I am now pursuing the Dutch MBA qualification (Modern Business Accounting) through evening classes and  expect to complete these studies in 2008. 

My interests are listening to music, cycling, travelling to different countries, attending get-togethers, visiting relatives &amp; historical places in India and watching selected movies &amp; TV programs. I enjoy visiting India for holidays.

Some info about Holland: 

It is possible to take up further studies in Holland in the English language in various disciplines. 

Career opportunities in Holland are very good for Engineers (all branches), IT professionals, Accountants, Finance, Marketing and Customer Service Professionals. 

Career opportunities are also very good for Teachers in International Schools in which the medium of instruction is English. 

Holland is one of the most advanced and internationally oriented countries in Europe. London and Paris can be reached from Amsterdam (capital of Holland) in one hour by a flight. 

Most Indians living in Holland visit India every year to spend time with their relatives. 

Moreover, telephone costs are quite low now-a-days; so one calls one's relatives/friends in India quite often. In addition, one can also make PC to PC and PC to Land-line phone calls worldwide which cost almost nothing. 

There are about 100 Indian families living within 30 kilometres from our house. Hence one can have a good social life with Indians, besides the local Dutch people. 

The working hours in Holland are regulated by law and thus no one works beyond 8 AM to 6 PM for long periods. Only exceptionally, do people work in week-ends as well. Commuting times in Holland are also generally short like 30 minutes or less. Thus, balancing the domestic responsibilities with a professional career is a lot easier in Holland than in India and U. S. A. As a consequence, the overall quality of life is a lot better in Holland than in many western countries.

Moreover, there are a lot of part-time jobs available in Holland in all professions. This also helps to balance the career with domestic responsibilities more easily.

Will provide additional details about Holland if you have interest to proceed further.","I am looking forward to meet a communicative, affectionate, understanding, moderately extrovert person who is brought up with a mix of Indian traditions and modern liberal values and who prefers inter-dependence with her life-partner rather than total independence on all matters. 

My partner's hobbies and interests need not be identical to mine; however, I look forward to someone with whom I can share many things with interest and enthusiasm from both of us and get thru the journey of life having plenty of fun-filled moments.

Though English is widely spoken in Holland, girls who would enjoy learning a European language (Dutch) after coming to Holland, besides having an active professional career would be most suitable. Those who know German or French can easily learn Dutch. Obviously, I will enjoy helping my future bride to learn the Dutch language. 

My future bride can decide herself whether she wants to continue with her career or be a home-maker.

My bride can also visit India to meet her relatives once a year on an average, excluding special occasions like weddings of close relatives/friends for which of course she can make an additional trip if required. 



","Arvind emigrated to Holland (Netherlands) with his parents and one brother 26 years back. His only brother, also an Accounting professional, moved to Dublin, Ireland in Nov. 2003. Father: Electronics Engineer, retired from a MNC in Holland in a Senior Executive position. Mother: Graduate &amp; Homemaker. The family is settled in Holland; however, all 4 persons have visited Mumbai/Chennai/Bangalore regularly.

We are a nuclear family and respect and follow Indian customs and traditions and both our sons are not ""overly westernised"". At the same time we are not orthodox. We believe we have the right balance between traditional and modern liberal values. Our sons respect elders and are proud of their Indian heritage.",25 to 30,13 Dec 1973,12:45:00,India,Others,Slim,Average,,Iyer,Brahmin,,,Fair ,Doesn't Matter,Self,B.Com (Commerce),"39 yrs, 5ft 9in,<br />

"Well it is hard to describe yourself in words but I'll give it a try.

Born and brought up in Jaipur. Went to IIT Delhi for engineering and then moved to US for work.

I am caring, warm and very easy to have a conversation with. I am told that I get along with almost anyone. I enjoy travelling, playing sports, watching movies, going out for dinners etc. I like to stay healthy and in shape. Ran Chicago Marathon 2011 &amp; 2012.

I consider myself as a person with good mix of traditional and modern values. I think in any relationship trust, love, and respect are the most important to have any successful relationship.

I am looking for a partner who shares some common interests, is close to their friends and family, who is social and wants to start a new journey in life...

Our forefathers had routes in Punjab area of now a days Pakistan. Not hailed from an affluent financial background though needs are easily satisfied, 
My Father owned a Shop of milk and dairy products since last 40 odd years .My Brother is running his work of DJ and catering in the city. Mom is a very pious home maker.
Presently we are staying in our ancestral house with my parents.It is 55 yard small typical two story buid onto free parental land situated in congested old area of the city.
Well build and neatly maintained. But our house is situated in a dense populated and Muslim surrounded area and that area not neat &amp; clean and entrance is also not proper. I won't like to stay here but every time my planning to purchase or build my own house with a bank loan got crashed by one reason or another.

We lost our parents many years back (Dad in 94 &amp; Mom in 99). I am younger to him. I have done my B-Tech in Computer Systems (from University of British Columbia, Canada) &amp; am residing in Australia with my Husband (working with a Top MNC in Melbourne) &amp; a naughty little son. I requested him to do a write-up about himself and this is what he came up with. Hi, I am an Electrical Engineer with Masters in HR &amp; Marketing.
