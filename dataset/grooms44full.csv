"Open minded, liberal in thought (but not in moral values) living, and learning. with each day as it comes... 
I like my life and as it is now I think its time to start sharing (or multiplying) it with someone.  I'm easy to get along unfussy with just about average living habits. 
Just need 4 walls, music, a functioning computer, a floor to sleep on and a square meal. And  my domestic needs are more than satisfied.
Have always been more interested in the functional aspect of things and phenomena rather than their appearances. 
LIkea good read or a movie, watch TV when I get the time. And yes Freinds is funny a lot of the time. THey seem to have really good writers on their staff there.
As for the rest of life, i believe that you either take it on the chin, or take it into your arms. Life will always go on! Make the right choices. 
I'm no poet, and i know it !! Oh I think I just blew it !!!
Sorry about this last bit. Have always professionally been into one form of communication medium or the other. Hence the prolixity of (perhaps) needless words.","Not a very demanding person, Oh what the the hell, would be disappointed however, if there weren't the occasional demands that I just don't get. And its beautiful !  Then full time attention and affection (just kidding at the last :). I have lived independently for a long time and enjoyed every moment (well almost every moment). 
Now would like to share that joy (and sorrrows, for evrynbody gets their fair share in life that need to be dealt with from time to time). But coming back to the joy, yes, I would now like to share (or rather,  multiply) it with a practicing dreamer. But more importantly, a woman with a zest for life. An appreciation of all the beautiful things life has to offer and a the chutzpah to go out there and get them (and the act of getting them itself may not be so beautiful sometimes).",,,10 Jun 1969,11:02:00,United Arab Emirates,Mumbai,Average,,,Sindhi,,,,Fair ,,Brother,BE B.Tech (Engineering),"44 yrs, 6ft,<br />

"I am a fun loving person who likes to travel a lot &amp; also has a passion for performing arts. A typical Libran, generally confident &amp; witty in my behavior. Flexibility is another asset because of which i tend to get along with people of all age groups and cultures. Not sounding too boastful but many of my friends consider me to be 'bindaas (care-free) types.... also Versatile. I warm up to a person easily but can cool off too, - fairly quickly.


God has adorned me with the gift of gab &amp; wit and I am a very expressive person. Friendly &amp; caring in general but rather candid at times. Never an audience. Always a player. always been a fighter in life ! Not routinely, but as a hobby, read a lot of books (fiction/non-fiction). Although it may seem difficult to believe from what you have read till now but I am very caring, forgiving and modest too. 


I have done pretty well for my self socially &amp; financially and off late have been feeling that its time that I found someone to share my dreams &amp; achievements with. Someone who would be the pivotal point for all things to come, around whom I may weave my plans for the future. Someone who can be my companion &amp; friend, to love and to cherish.....



My Job: Own a Company involved in the business of real estate development.","Looking for someone who is sincere, rational and grounded. An articulate person.... who is in tune with herself and has respect both for herself and others. Knows when to lead n when to follow &amp;   also how to walk hand-in-hand. A person uninfluenced by trends or popular opinion. Someone I can talk with &amp;   grow with intellectually and emotionally. Who wants to love and be loved. If she is compassionate and graceful then I guess She could be the one.

"This must be one of the most difficult things I have tried to do. I am attempting to describe in this space a work in progress. ThatAA?A?s how I see myself. 

I believe that things happen for a reason and the people you meet in life are people you are meant to meet at that point of your life. I have dreams and ambitions but IAA?A?ll leave those for later. 

I like my work- on good days I feel like a fraud for taking money to do a job that gives me so much pleasure. But this is on good days, on bad days- m not paid enough to put up with the nonsense I have to deal with! 

I am not a party animal. When I go out I prefer to spend time with people I know well. We could do anything from just staying home, watching a movie, to dancing the night away (been a while since I did that- but I can still remember it!), or experimenting with food. I like eating different cuisines. 

I have been told that I have an off beat sense of humour. ItAA?A?s kind of weird, sarcastic and sometimes downright dark. It takes getting used to. 

I cherish my family and friends. I feel blessed and honoured to have them in my life. 

Stuff I like
Music: Santana, Elvis, Kenny Rogers, , Dinsey Movie Tunes, UB40, music with Soul and music I can sing along with.... 
 have to mention I like reading comic strips my favourite-Calvin &amp; Hobbes

I love to travel. I have to plan my holidays - lots of places I want to experience; like the Himalayas Hemkund sahab in Himachal, Kashmir, Amazon rain forests, Peru, Venice, Milan, Egypt, Ladak, the small South-East Asian countries where I can backpack, live like a local and just beAA?A.. Work gets in the way!!

I relax by hanging out with friends. I can discuss anything on this earth but discussions should not turn into a argument just for the sake of winning. 
What I am looking for in my soulmate-..... Honesty above all. She must love to cook (need not be edible) so that I can learn from her, know how to have fun, be able to sit still at peace with herself say everything and nothing in silence. A romantic streak would be helpful and appreciated! Must have a wacky sense of humour. Someone who is ready to except her mistakes gracefully AA?A
I want my soul to know that bond of sharing a peaceful space with another person.","What I am looking for in my soul mate: Honesty above all.

I stand 5'9 tall, weigh 78 kg and would consider myself to be in average build. I have short straight black hair and my eyes are dark.

 I have a doctorate and currently I am employed in a teaching/administrative capacity. 

Some of my favorites include Chinese food, pop music and I enjoy watching comedy movies at home. I play tennis, cricket, football and billiards,

I am a straight forward person. People say that I can make a stone to talk! I like rainy days and mondays...... never thought marriage...was too serious with my studies and spent too many years in the academic wilderness....and still in it! Right now I am doing some post doctoral studies. I enjoy writing poems in my spare time and I think I have a poetic element in me!I am looking forward to an enduring relationship.......a life without counting the cost. Have been to so many places and enjoy life as it comes.

"Was raised in a fairly devout family and my education in some of the best Catholic Institutions at B'lore has largely contributed in shaping my personality. Independent, easygoing, adopting a very practical approach to achieving my objectives and at times dealing with life's complexities. Also a lighthearted, articulate and forward looking person always striving to give it my best in everything I do, with a flair for uniqueness. Constantly in pursuit of refinement in life, as it progresses.

I must add that I am young at heart and quite versatile too! Though, not compromising too much on my cultural and spiritual roots, retaining some traditional values of an 'Indian family' as well.

A SELF-MADE PERSON AND AN ETERNAL OPTIMIST!

"For me, family is supreme and always top priority. I am seeking simplicity, humility and sacrifice as the foundations of a lifelong relationship with someone who believes in these traits too. Needless to say, I happily offer all of it myself, and more. I am a person who loves to smile, laugh, live a peaceful life with lots of 'togetherness', have dinner together, chat together. I am intense, I am romantic, but nothing is better to define me than the fact that I am humane. I understand and empathize with pain, maybe because I have seen a lot of it myself. I need someone to hold my hand, who is understanding, who knows what it is like to be cruelly slapped by destiny one sudden day, to be devastated, and how it is to rebuild life, brick by brick against all odds. I am basically a very simple and transparent person and love to see my loved ones smiling.  I am sure I have everything by the grace of God that can keep my spouse happy for life, give her all possible comforts and all kinds of emotional and financial securities.","Would prefer a simple and humble partner who prefers to be a housewife and would help and support me in building a strong and lovingly bonded family together.

"I did a graduate course and then a professional course in London. 

I have been a British citizen since birth. I have lived in Africa, India and Europe. Indian communities live in some African and European nations. I am a citizen of this planet, galaxy and universe, too. 

I can speak English, Hindi, and Gujarati. I know some French. I am good natured, highly self-disciplined, calm, cool-headed, adaptable, friendly and cooperative. I keep a low profile. I am medium built. I like keeping myself physically fit. 

For relaxation, I meditate and listen to Western and Eastern classical music. I like pop songs, too. 

I am seeking a good woman to marry between the age 22 to 35 from any caste or any religion from any country. Life is what you make of it. One should treat every small setback in life as a bigger need to advance further. I believe in simple marriages (where money is not wasted on big, expensive and extravagant marriages). 

Everything is questionable not only on this planet but on millions of other earth-like planets in the universe. 

I believe film and modelling industries exploit, dehumanise and con human beings. Money is not everything. Would I act in the film/modelling industry? Never. There is a moral dimension to life.","I am seeking a good woman to marry between 22 to 38

"My simplicity and decency describes me and my nature well. Due to my simple nature I have acquired a lot of good things and people around me. 
In my professional life I like being serious and do my work with full commitment. Presently I am working as an accountant in a well known organization. Like everyone I also want to grow in my profession and make my parents feel proud of me. 
One of my major weaknesses is that I am very sensitive.
My mother is a homemaker and father has taken retirement from his profession. My brother is engrossed in the diamond business and doing well. I also have a lovable sister who is married and well settled in her life. 
In my higher education sector I have completed B Com from Gujarat University. 
I dona??t like to share my feelings with many people and like to be reserved when it comes to making friends. Though I have few friends in my life but they are the best part of my life. 
Music is an art of living a peaceful life and avoiding the major complexities and problems of life. Therefore, I like listening to music and also watching movies. Another hobby of mine is travelling to new places.","The girl to whom I will get married to should be well qualified and settled in her life. I want her to be simple and soft spoken so that both of us can lead a happy and stress free life ahead. My preference will be given to a girl from Gujarat posing a good family background. 
She should be flexible enough to fit in my family and once she will enter my family, then she will receive lot of love from them. My family would happily accept her and will not change her as per their thinking.
Only thing I expect from my wife is to respect my parents and other family members. In return her family will also receive complete respect and love from my side. 
I will always be there to assist my wife with the tasks at home and outside home. If she is like the one I am looking for then I assure her a happy future ahead.

"hello.  my name is dongun shin from south korea.  

i lived in kerala for 8 years in amritapuri (from 1999 to 2008).  i loved kannu, kayamkulam, allepy, kollam, trivandrum, trishu, palakad and valikavu.  i know kerala cities very well and visited there many many times.  i liked ernakulam (kochin) a lot especially marine drive.  probably if you live in kerala or have visited amritapuri, i guess you may have seen me in streets or in the ashram already. you may know me already. 

i have an indian name which kerala amma (mata amritanandamayi) gave me.  my indian name is shankara.  I went by that name in india.  i studied yoga and dhyan in amritapuri ashram for 8 years.

when i was in india, i visited many indian cities as a hindu philgrim; mumbai, varanasi, arunachala, deli, chennai, deli, kolkata, hyderabad etc. 

i love ramakrishna and krishna and swami shankara and rama and vivekananda and swami aiyepa and shirdi sai baba.  i love hindu religion and hindus a lot.  

I love mahabharata, srimad bhagavatam, and ramayana.  arjuna is my favorite. 

hanuman is my favorite deity as well.   

in india, I took indian violin lessons from some indian violin proffesor in idapalli(kochin) and studied indian music a little bit.  sa re ga ma pa da ni sa.  

i graduated from the university of jeonbook in korea, and studied 4 more years in u.s. (university of oregon)

i am very family oriented and love only 1 girl of my life eternally who i am waiting for.  

i studied malayalam a little bit and found korean and malayalam are very simillar language grammatically. 

korean is a very well living country.   you will be happy here in korea.  I will take good care of you.  i loved mumbai and mumbai's marine drive. 

here in korea, i run a shop that sell korean food and the shop is o.k.  i would like to make you happy, if you choose me as your husband.  I am very very healthy and energetic.  you do not need to worry about my health.  

my brother lives in boston, u.s. and he has a very beautiful wife and a son and a girl.  he is also very much family oriented.  he is a very good father and husband.  

thanks for reading my 'about me'",my spouse's religion does not matter with me.  i accept all religion.  i love people with sinciere any religion.  you do not need to worry about your religious practice when you married me.  ,,18 to 41,08 Sep 1969,,India,,Average,,,,,,,Fair ,,Self,B.A. (Arts),"44 yrs, 5ft 7in,<br />
