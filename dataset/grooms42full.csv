"ASAK. 

A bit daunted with dipping my toe into the cyber-pool, but ok, here goes. 
Thanks for taking the time to read my pitch. I don't think I'll launch into my autobiography at this moment, just briefly, I come from a traditional, yet progressive, very well respected Muslim family. 

I love life and would like to share my passion for life with someone special. 

I am an active person and I play all kinds of sports as well as horse ride. IA?AAA?AAA?Am a bit of a movie buff, but tend to be more inclined towards those with happy endings. 

I have a passion for the arts, musical performances from flamenco to salsa to Verdi's requiem, art galleries and sipping on a cup of coffee at a local coffee shop, although nothing comes close to a half-cup of Desi tea after a long hard day at the office - Champion!
 
One of my addictions is travel, the adrenalin rush of packing up and dislocating to an unfamiliar location even for longer periods than a holiday - nothing like treading in unfamiliar waters and immersing oneself in different cultures. 
Is there any fun in life without surprises?
 
I believe marriage is a partnership and believe that each partner must learn to appreciate the others strengths. I am family oriented and am looking for someone who believes strongly in family values.

I've been fortunate to come from a good family originally from India (U. P). I was born and raised in the UK. I probably have more of a western influence, but many aspects of Indian culture are sprinkled in my life.","My ideal partner like me will be larger than life but humble with it. Will have strong faith in Allah (SWT), energetic, charismatic, with a lively sense of humour; she will be my peace. 
Classy, dynamic, sophisticated, passionate and polished, she should be willing to test her limits and challenge mine. We will fill our home with love and will respect and honour each other.

"I would describe myself as a bon vivant, forever optimistic, forever flippant, upbeat, confident, self-aware (often painfully so), shy yet gregarious regular Joe kind of guy. I have lived in over 22 countries, and can pretty much get along with most people. I am very empathetic and a good listener and talk a lot at times. Am a social liberal (way off the charts), fiscally conservative in the collective, fiscal liberal in the individual. 

The East would call me a hermit; the West would call me anhedonstic. I am more tuned into pleasures of the intellect; as a consequence, I am very introspective and abstract (woolly headed :)) and spend more time thinking than anything else. I read/write philosophy and psychology outside of work; play the violin and generally lounge around doing nothing other times. 

I am a businessperson with a portfolio of tech product companies in various stages of growth from early stage onwards. I split my work time between the US, UK and India. 

I have learned to let go of a pre-defined set of expectations in my partner, probably because for most people (myself included) self-representation is different from reality. 
Would definitely prefer somebody who looks physically compatible to me (I am reed thin neck downwards). While I definitely get along with most people (and love repetition :)) I would definitely like somebody who is fiercely independent and values my need for me-time/space as much as she likes hers.

"They say that it is quite hard to win a woman while marryingAA?Abut... me say the very word 'WIN' undermine her entity... it is rather more important to let her feel that in groom's characteristics her aspirations are met to an admissible extent AA?Aand reward is... she will bestow her hand, heart and soulAA?A. Please go on to read 

I feel I can be described for matrimonial information as: 

-	A successful professional who is self made 
-	Being intelligent and articulate 
-	Being neatly dressed 
- Good looking and being well-groomed
-	Aware to the need of partner for the focus of his attention
-	Ability for Honest conversation, Laughter and a sense of humor 
-	Complimenting his partner and being sincere about her -	
-	Knowing what's going on in the world
-	Not bragging constantly about himself and his achievements 
-	Broadminded AA?A? Liberal AA?A? Clean Habits AA?A? Unblemished character
-	At ease with western and eastern lifestyle
-	Ardent stand for simple and Dowry-less marriage

I value and acknowledge the sanctity of life- long- marriage relationship. 

I cherish my high paced, social welfare oriented job of being an Editor in a news magazine. It gives me opportunity to experience &amp; handle the different faces of lifeAA?Afrom interaction with highest power wielders to hear the most destitute within short period. Ride in a Limousine and bullock cart within hours. This high flying and amphibious, as well, job had taken me to wide national and international placesAA?Ahence made me more aware and Humane.. able to see life in totality.. And being whistle blower to the society is more rewarding than a individualistic job. After all gaining a AA?A?License to shootAA?A? &amp; AA?A?MaimAA?A?... albeit with camera and penAA?Aright from head of state to commoners is far more meaningful than to secure a million dollar profession ..where more the salary...more the target...more the responsibility...less &amp; less time...all the luxuries but no quality time for near and dear one.

I love to explore place, like to travel and trekking, open to new experiments, have creative bent of mind, sophisticated taste. Am extrovert, jovial and outreaching type. Positive thinking and Fun loving. 

Mine is a respectable Punjabi lineage with Hindu-Sikh mixed family. Thorough bred in cosmopolitan cities, both mother and father passed away. One brother and a Sister, both elder to me, are married and living in Delhi. Dad was world famous ace camera engineer. 

I am blesses with good health genre that me and family have no known history of hereditary diseases like asthma, diabetes, cancer, heart or others. 

I am very Liberal in religious values, a non ritualistic believer. Close to Sufism. 

Am looking for a women who is at same wavelength, progressive, awake to her rights and duties of marriage institution. With sense of humor, tasteful, classy and humane. Within compatible parameters of our mutual physique attritions. 


I am aware and confident to deliver that as a husband I am dutiful to give limitless and lifelong care, affection, space, support, attention and love to my soul mateAA?AI mean it. 

Literally being a single soul i can afford to relocate should the need demands.

Thanks for your time and best of luck in your search","A true matching partner makes the sail of life a bliss. 

I wish that my would be spouse should feel that in me she has find the complimentary half of herself that is synonym to  ""Made for Each Other"".
So that i have more than reasons to proudly pronounce her to be my ""Better Half""

I wish her To be my soul mate rather than a spouse Per Se.

Real Life partners are those whom death part only and this conjugation should not be one life affair but timeless partnership.

I wish her to be Intelligent, Accommodative, Responsible and pro-active partner.

A home maker and co-pilot in every course of married life.

My wish list for prospective life partner is that she should match my profile to compatible level.

I want her to equal-shoulder the fiscal, strategic &amp;     familial responsibilities along with me.

She should have sense that home is not a premises where some number of people live for the sake of life  but it is an adobe where souls nestles with mates eternal.

That she should strive to make marriage not a single life affair but a bonding that is timeless.

"To Begin with, the Email ID given is not my real ID. All other info given are correct.

People who know me consider me as honest and sincere. It is very easy to give company to others when they are well placed and comfortable in life. I think this is one aspect people appreciate about me - That I support people when they really need it.

I am an independent person who value family, friends, society. I am not one of those type whom you can meet in party halls and clubs. I have a more serious approach towards life. 

At the same time, I am not conservative. I am very open minded and progressive. But I respect other's right to have their own beliefs and faiths. When I say, I am not selfish in my life approach, that also means that I consider I have some commitment towards my society. I hope my future life-partner appreciate this. This may be a strange sentence in any matrimonial profile. However, I feel I should be frank.

I have seen life and I have learnt things. I dont have huge expectations, I dont ask dowry, money or anything. In fact, I dont give any importance to age, marital status, career etc of my future partner. I dont ask what is your past. But I do ask what will be our future. What I am looking for is a good heart and the ability to stand by me in my good time and bad time. I have seen a lot of people, but I have seen very few people with genuinely open mind. Please understand that, an open mind is the minimum requirement for two people to live under the same shelter, by mutually supporting each other.","As I specified earlier, I dont have much expectations. I dont believe in arranged marriage and that is one reason why I am here. I dont ask much, but please give me a chance to talk each other and understand each other before we both can come to any decision.  I dont ask anything from you, except a good heart and an open mind.

"I am professionally qualified as CPA (USA), CISA (USA), CA (India) and CWA (India). I am very family orientated, loyal, responsible person and I have a moderate outlook on life. I am quite organised in personal and professional life. I am smart, hard working, and ambitious person, however I will always stay away from manipulating people and vice versa. I have worked / traveled and seen many different places. Though I am an accountant by profession, but I am definitely not a stereotypical boring person. I enjoy travelling, trying new things and seeing new places and experiencing new cultures. At home I enjoy reading books, watching movies, listening to soft music and sometimes cooking. When time comes I can do most of the house chores and would love to learn to Braai etc. I am out going and fun to hang out with and can enjoy a good night out every now and then. I would sure love dancing, but can't, and same goes with swimming. Though I don't drink and smoke, but it has never stopped me from making friends. I am very friendly, quite spontaneous, like meeting new people, and love being around people, and having fun. I'm fun loving, easy going, down to earth, gentle, kind, generous, frank, relaxed, good listener and open minded person. I believe in being honest, loyal, having high morals and treating people how I wish to be treated. I love life and genuinely look after people and I love spoiling the people close to me. I have a very good sense of humour, sociable and easy to talk to. At times, I can be serious and outspoken at times and shy when meeting new people for the first time. I am very self-confident and always support and stand for right things in life. I don't shy away from emotion and is man enough to face own and those of loved ones. I believe that communication, honesty, trust, humour and respect are key ingredients in a healthy relationship.","I am looking for a match who will make me feel complete and co-dependent and will feel the same with me. An appreciation of books, art, sports, movies, music and fine food would be great. Someone I can learn from and more importantly learn with - and openly admits when he still needs to learn. Someone, who appreciates and places value on the important things in life. Someone, who is willing to continue with her career, focused, strong willed yet sensitive, ambitious, resourceful, hard working and resilient. Someone, who is easy going, not high strung and judgemental, a good listener and be able to converse, who enjoys being around people and is comfortable just being themselves. Someone, who has good sense of humour, loves the outdoors, pets, enjoys movies, theatre, reading, quiet time at home, have a quick wit, lots of self-respect and a sure hold on life, honest, down-to-earth and positive.

Someone who wants to be loved and can love me back, someone to share the good and the bad times, person with a positive, happy outlook on life. Someone, who has honesty, integrity, sincerity, character, smart, educated, intelligent, kind, warm hearted, knows what she wants, a romantic at heart, and who looks after herself. I'd like to say I'm an ""old school"" kind of guy and never believed I'd meet my partner in a bar. I would like to visit places, having dinner or doing window shopping with her, to know her better.

"When it comes to writing about oneself, it is a very Herculean task. The wise used to say that a person who recognizes others is intelligent; but a person who recognizes oneself is wise. And I am trying to recognize myself and hence I say it is a very daunting task to write about oneself. Anyways I am making a sincere effort in that direction.

For start, I am very proud of being an Indian and its vast and diversified culture.  I love to celebrate all festivals.  I stay in Bandra, Mumbai and am a Bandraite. I did my schooling in Bandra, Mumbai. I then did my graduation in Science. I come from a family which have an urge to pursue knowledge, and I could not be left behind. I then went on to do my law and later my Management. I am now practicing law. I am appearing for Solicitors exams. Since childhood I had a lot of love for sports. My brother and one of my sisters too have been active sports persons. Hence we are very health conscious and keep ourselves fit. I believe a healthy body breeds a healthy mind and vice versa. Hence I do Yoga and Meditation to have a healthy mind along with a health body.","It is said that 'Beauty lies in simplicity'. I am looking for a simple girl. She should be well educated. We are a well and closely knit family. We love people and hence we go that extra yard to maintain relations with relatives and friends.

She should have respect for elders and shower love on the young of the family. She should be able to be become my best friend. One of the major traits I am looking for is understanding and adjusting nature as a woman can build or break a home. I may be asking too much but then that's human.",Father and Mother were both classical Musicians. Both have expired.  Elder Brother self employed not married.

"This is one of the most difficult tasks. My friends describe me as: witty, confident, outgoing, honest and a happy go lucky person. I value hard work and honesty. I am a calm person with a lot of patience and understanding. Motto in life: God has given us this one beautiful life and let?s make the most of it. I am very fond of classical music and play the sitar. I am also passionate about sports, reading and traveling. People say I look very much younger than my age. I was a sportsperson so naturally I am very health conscious. I regularly go for jogging and do yoga to keep my body and mind fit.

I am well qualified; having possessed a Bachelors Degree in Science, a Bachelors Degree in Law and a Master Degree in Management. I chose to practice Law and to satisfy my yearning to study further I am appearing for my solicitors exam...","I am looking for a girl who epitomizes simplicity, intelligence, trust, friendship and understanding. For me marriage is a relationship which is based on friendship, trust, respect and love for each other. A girl who believes that marriage is a union not only of two wonderful souls but also of two loving families. I would appreciate it if she had a liking for sports, adventure and travel.

I am on the verge of beginning my life and am in search for that special person who would like to make a new beginning with me and walk with me till the end.
","I belong to a very respectable and reputed family. My paternal grandfather was a well know musician. My maternal grandfather was a well know doctor. My father was a very well known musician. He was the guru of Asha Bhosale, Pankay Udhas and Pt. Jitendra Abisheki to name a few. My elder brother is a bachelor handling our agricultural business. Both my elder sisters are happily married and residing in Mumbai. Relatives well educated and hold a prominent place in society.

"Currently in middle management of a Big4 (yes, they exist), based in Chicago. Have been with them for over three years now and hating every minute of it :-).

Very down to earth and practical and hope for a similar behavioral pattern in return. Not a big music aficianado, but appreciate good music of all generes. Have however not been able to relate to its american form (save a few good ones). Used to read a lot (seems like a long time ago) but that has now dwindled with work taking over. Religious to a degree, but my practicality mostly obviates this.

My right brain rules me. Instincts have taken me farther in life than I can rationalize (no pun). This translates to a tremendously flexibile personality which forms the premise of my strong belief that compatibility is not about wanting the same things and having the same interests, but about recognizing and respecting them of each other.

"hi, this is moorthy. i am 40 years old, still single. if u r wondering why i am still single that's long story. if u are looking for a well educated forward looking progressive person with a spiritual and professional attitude, then read further. 

i have gone thro quite a few challenging times from the age 20 and have become strong mentally and spiritual in the process. as u can see i have lost my hair and goodlooks but if u r person who goes by looks of a person rather than inner qualities, then pls ignore my profile. 

i believe in simple living and high thinking.i feel one should lead life for ideals rather than for desires.i read lot of books on wide ranging topics and i believe we are what we read.i also believe one should take their work or profession seriously,but should not take life or themselves too seriouly.i am very easy going person who believes one should achieve something with one's life.that's why i take my work seriously.i dont mind having fun in life as all work and no play makes life boring. 

i have a bachelor of business management degree from india and a masters degree in information technology from australia. i am a permanent resident of australia. right now i am living in my native town in andhrapradesh and looking after my familys agricultural properties. there is a reason why i am in india, i can share that with my possible partner. after marriage i plan to go to australia and settle down in sydney.after my masters in 2002 i worked only for 1 year in sydney and that too a NON-IT job.since there is long gap after my masters,i plan to do one more masters in IT and work simultaneously in australia.i plan to work for sometime in sydney and then do something on my own in the IT industry.these are my plans after marriage.my family is very sound financially and i can afford to stay at my native town and take care of my family's properties.i can lead a very comfortable life doing that.but i have travelled extensively in south of india and studied abroad and have some dreams and ambitions to fulfill.

If u r interested in my profile,my dreams and want to know more about me then leave a message for me.otherwise thanx for stopping by and all the best in your partner search.cheers.","we are a traditional agricultural family from east godavari district,AP,India .we are a land holding family. my father is a doctor and travelled extensively in the world.my mother is a housewife.both my brother and sister are educated in the U.S and setteled in the US.though we are from a traditional background we have international exposure and have a progressive outlook.

We are a family of three and I am the only son. I come from a family where moral values are given importance. I am a bit religious and a sensitive person. I am looking for a person who would stand by my side as a friend through thick and thin.

"You would find me to be funny, attractive, romantic, adventurous, wise, down to earth, very free minded, modest, loving, caring, passionate and a talented singer. I treasure every moment that I will be fortunate to share with my wife, 'cause I believe that life is meant to be enjoyed and not to be wasted on all those weird things that the world is so busy doing.  About me, I am an innocent divorcee without any issues and I was the victim of a woman who didn't have the slightest idea of what a marriage meant and never knew the meaning of love.  Actually, it was my fault as I had rushed into this arranged marriage and I was not patient to study the person properly.  Anyway, I intend to be careful this time and I don't want to take any chances.  But from my side, you can surely expect everything that you would require from a true husband and I promise that I would always stand committed and loyal towards my wife for eternity.  I am a very God fearing person as well and I never intend to live a life that is not pleasing to God.  I am also a striving perfectionist and I always like to explore new things in life and love to travel all over the world and become a part of all that God has to offer us.  I have a great passion for music and it is my ambition to release my own albums one day soon.

"Well, about me ..... hmm... I am a smart young man full of life, a jolly person but a bit moody, reliable and responsible, sensitive and caring, creative and imaginative, romantic, very much loving and affectionate (a born lover A?. Born on the Valentines Day !). I believe that life is a precious gift of God and has to be nurtured with love and care and lived to the fullest. I am a graduate engineer (electronics) and working as a Service Engineer for a japanese MNC. 
About my likes and dislikes .... I love motorbikes, swimming, picnics.....I love listening to music and singing songs that have sensitive lyrics and tunes that touch the heart. I love wearing jeans. I believe that 'WOMAN ' is God's most beautiful creation on this earth and I admire his wonderful and excellent piece of work. I am a lover of art. I hate people with double standards.
About my desired match, well.... I would desire someone very beautiful, preferably with nice long hair ( lambe baal, gore gaal)and also caring and understanding who will love me 24 hours a day and 365 days a year and... well well thats too much of expectations from my side and "" If wishes were horses, beggars would ride."" but miracles do happen although compromise is very much necessary.

"Thanks for stopping by to read my profile.

AA?AWell, I really donAA?A?t know where to start. I havenAA?A?t had to update my professional resume in years either, but I can't leave my search for life partner special to chance. 

So, to describe meAA?A
My background is Sri Lankan, was born in Sri Lanka but left at a young age to live in Africa for 10 years. Now living in Toronto Canada for 20 years. 
I have a good blend of eastern and western cultures. By nature I am a friendly person, down-to-earth, ambitious, hard working, funny, caring, sensitive, and honest with real zest for real life striving for challenges and face them with optimism. 

IAA?A?m in good shape, take care of my body and appreciate others who do as well. TheyAA?A?re also more likely to understand me spending time in the gym :-) I appreciate a wide variety of music and love to dance. IAA?A?m willing to try almost anything at least once. I really enjoy playing nearly any sport, but IAA?A?m far from a master of any. The fun is in improving. If youAA?A?re looking for someone who'll learn something new with you, IAA?A?m a good candidate.

I come from a nuclear family, have a younger brother, a Doctor and both my parents are retired processionals living in Toronto.

From an educational and professional aspect,
All my post-secondary education was in Toronto and have a degree in Engineering from McMaster University. Currently employed as a Software development project manager for a major north-American insurance company. Been with the company for 14 years so I am pretty content professionally.

Ok now what am I looking for?
IAA?A?m looking for a lady I find attractive (both inside and out), with whom I find chemistry, to care about and who'll care about me. Someone whoAA?A?ll share my love of the outdoors, games, parties, animals, travel, the simpler things and inspires me to want to be her perfect man.

If this peaks your interest, drop me a note.
Please include photographs when responding.

-thank you.","Attractive lady with whom I find good chemistry, mutual love and care. unmarried or divorced from a good family background, well educated, slim, family oriented",,26 to 33,16 Jun 1971,,Canada,Others,Athletic,Slim,,Velaan/Vellalar,Velaan/Vellalar,Others,,Fair ,Whetish Medium,Son,B.Sc (Science),"42 yrs, 5ft 10in,<br />

I am looking for a positive person and who has the spirit to take up challenges and overcome them. A good sense of humor is most welcome!!! Understanding each other and taking care of each other is key to happy marriage...!! 

i've gone thru a brief marriage... lasted 2 months with no physical intimacy... more when we make contact... 
I think being happy doesn't mean that everything is perfect. It means you've decided to look beyond the imperfections and accept...

"I am a simple &amp; straighforward person. Don't like pretension at all. My hobbies are watching tv, internet browsing, nature, travel, reading books and listening to classic music &amp; most of all cooking.

As a human being, i would not differenciate among fellow human beings on the basis of their religion, race, caste or origin. So the caste system, race, ethenicity or cultural differences means nothing to me. When looking for my future love, I will keep these things in mind.

When it comes to family life, i believe in total equality. My life partner will have the right to make decisions for herself and the family as long as those decisions are moral and legal.","Note: Please make sure you leave your contact details in your message. Many thanks.

A mature person with slim, slender or athletic body, vivacious and most of all simple, creative, ambitious and multitalented. Some one who is humble but not weak because these are two different things. Someone who don't differentiate other fellow beings because of their caste, race, ethenicity, religion and material status in this world.

She must have a positive mentality on life and doesn't know words like 'it is hard' or 'it is impossible'.

I must say a few more things here. Your chances of getting me are slim if:

1. You pluck your eye-brows to make them ridiculously thin
2. Have tattoos on main parts of the body and
3. Piercings on any parts of the body except ears and nose.
