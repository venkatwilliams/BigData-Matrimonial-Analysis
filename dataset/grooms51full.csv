"I am a down-to-earth person, who believes in the basic good values of life i.e, God fearing, respect for others and working hard to do better in life. I love to laugh, travel and share what God has given me with others (Seva). I am also flexible and willing to do what it takes to make my partner in life happy and content.  In this complex world of busy schedules and fast life, there is always a moment to do prayer daily and do my part in charitable work that can make a difference in other peoples' lives.  Overall, I believe I am a giving person without seeking much in return. I see my life as a beautiful collection of things that the Almighty gave me out of my good fortune and I am so glad to live this blessed life. I enjoy every moment of it and want to share it with that Special Someone. I respect and regard the views of others. I especially get along very well with my elders. In my daily profession of being a doctor, I have the opportunity to treat so many diverse people with various illnesses.  Also, I do teaching in my office during which medical students come for their core rotation in Medicine.  This gives me tremendous satisfaction to see that some of my students go on to become great doctors with some of the principles that I taught them while they were rotating with me.  I am seeking a life-partner because I feel I still have a lot to give and be happy with the grace of God.","I am an open minded person who is interested in re-marrying for the sake of sharing my life with a genuine person who cares for the simple life values, is honest and caring.  Life is about adapting to various situations presented and I am seeking someone who is willing to adapt and be willing to share the compassion and happiness that comes with being an equal partner. I care and respect our elders as they deserve our best treatment so I am seeking the same values in my partner.  I dress appropriately for most occasions and do reasonable amount of socializing as and when time permits so I would like my partner to be outgoing yet take of the family needs as the first priority. Overall, we can talk more about this when we meet in person or when we communicate with each other.",I am very family-oriented when it comes to various activities and events which we share together.

"I am sending this mail to you based on the Age as prospective BRIDE and not for the Qualification, Designation and Employment and also I do not have either Inferiority complex or Egoistic personality, with little options to choose from the Brahmin community.  
A friend is the best companion in the walks of life and I am looking for one who understands that it is as important to share A?A?tearsAA?A as it is to share Laughter. The equation of life should be balanced by the heart and mind alike. Traditional values should be as important as liberated ones. If you think Independence is equally important as being dependent and find yourselves is suitable, please do go through this mail. 
The Art of Marriage has to be learned and like parenthood comes with no instructions to follow. Tradition, Religion, Parental, Societal forces have been the conventional that keep a marriage togetHER which is a deep affirmation of a longstanding human tradition.

"Simplicity is the one of the best qualities in people. I admire this in people and I am very proud to say that I possess the same quality. According to me, it is the most wonderful thing. People who are simple are respected a lot by people. 
Being simple is like an asset to me. Many people around me respect me because of that. I am in the good books of people whom I like because of this. However, sometimes I suffer because of this habit of mine. People take advantage of me at times. 
I am into Government Service and I am Senior Supervisor in a PSU. I am very happy with my profession and I am satisfied with the act that I have professional stability. I want to stick to the same field and achieve the maximum growth in it. 
I have done a Diploma in Electrical Engineering from MEI Polytechnic, Bangalore. I was always a very sincere person, not only in student life but while I was working too. 

When I have some days off from work, I pack my bags and go out for travelling with my family or with my friends.","I prefer a girl who is from Karnataka or Bangalore. This is because I live in Bangalore and I want the girl to be from nearby. This way she will not have much trouble in adjusting with the place. She can also visit her parents whenever she feels like without travelling much. 
I would like to marry a homemaker. This is because I would like her to take care of the family and household. I am sure she will seek a lot of respect and love from me if she is an efficient homemaker. This is very important in a relationship. 
I donAa?a?t have many people in my family but four sisters. I hope she is successful in carrying out a good and healthy relationship with them. They all will adore her a lot if she is like that. 
She needs to be very caring and loving. This will not only help her in seeking love and respect from me but my family too. They will adore her if she is affectionate to them. Her loving nature can avoid many problems and quarrels that families have these days. 
The girl I get married to needs to be very adjustable. If she adjusts in my family sooner she will get a lot of love and care from my family members. I am sure she will enjoy it and give them the same love back. 
She will have a wonderful married life if she is what I expect her to be.",I have lost both my parents and now that I do not have them I miss them a lot. I have four sisters and they all are very close to me. I have always been there for them and I am sure I will be there for them in future too. ,18 to 18,18 Apr 1955,07:25:00,India,Bangalore,Slim,Doesn't Matter,,Others,,,,Fair ,Fair,Self,Other Diploma,"58 yrs, 5ft 7in,<br />

"It is very difficult to describe oneself in a truthful manner. However, let me try to do the same.
I am a simple person having the weakness to be caring, kindhearted, down to earth, passionate, jovial on majority of occasions, which are not liked by many in this materialistic world. Sometimes, I am also workholic.
I had the weakness to learn which resulted in obtaining Doctorate in French Language from J.N.U., New Delhi and thereafter LLB from Delhi University. 
I had the weakness to write thereby resulting in expressing my points of view of varied subjects, though my view differ with majority views.
My parents are no more- mother died in 1974 when I was 13 years old and Father died in 1982 when I was 21years old. God never blessed me with any sister. I had one elder brother, who had also died in 2005 leaving behind his wife, three young and handsome sons and a beautiful daughter, who have done graduation and post graduation. 
My last marriage lead to mutual divorce in the Court. I had thought to pass the remaining life alone, but feel need of a companion, so all this search. Hope to find a companion of life through this forum. I am a cosmopolitan and do not believe in differentia on caste, creed, religion etc. for which I feel my companion to be independent in her endeavour.

"Hi, I am a smart, tall guy and my personality belies my age. Basically, a management professional by qualification and a creative director out of sheer passion to tell a visual story. Had my higher education in Australia. Worked for reputed organizations in India and Australia, and in diverse jobs. Worked for a world famous health care company in India. My creative and innovative work notched me the two coveted awards- The All India Best Salesman &amp; All India Best Manager. Upon my return from Australia in 2001, I have been concentrating on my creative pursuit. Recently did a film for a Govt. organization and the film received rave reviews. Currently doing good corporate films and documentaries. Discussing with prospective producers on eight great stories that I have scripted. I have sacrificed lot of corporate positions for the sake of being a filmmaker. Effective Jan 09, I took a small break from my creative pursuit and joined a major super specialty hospital in Chennai, as the Chief Hospital Administrator, and remained in that position until April 2010. It was not my cup of tea even though I enjoyed it. I am cool guy and take things easy. Believe in saying ""No Worries"". Equally, I communicate without inhibitions.  I am a strict vegetarian, non-smoker and an occasional drinker. Have plenty of hobbies and interest, which would run to pages. I am a participative person. I don't believe in religion, caste and creed. I hail from a respectable family. My father, a retired educationist, widely traveled and a former US Full Bright Scholar; My wonderful and beloved mother passed away recently. Have three brothers- two elder and one younger. All of them are professionals, married and blessed with a single child. My two elder brothers have relocated to India for their son's higher education. Younger brother is settled in Chicago. No sister and I really long for one. Well, I am looking for a professional girl so that the wavelength matches.","Prefer a professional in any field with a liberal views and outlook.

"Life is A Celebration Enjoy!!!! You Live Only Once!!
 
 I believe in the dictum - love to live, live to love. Give your best to get the best!!!All relationships blossom into loving relationships when people decide to share instead of trying to change each other. Do not expect your ideal soulmate to be someone who is always loving and easy to get along with, who agrees with everything you say or do, and who brings you a life of ease and comfort. Enthusiasm is the best protection in any situation. Wholeheartedness is contagious, so give yourself, if you wish to get others. It is your life, just imagine the possibilities!

I am looking for a partner who can celebrate the joy called 'life' with me. I want tons of laughter, loads of peace and a world of giving and sharing. Hey, hell is what we make of our lives!Heaven is how alive we can be... the sheer rapture of it!!! There is no wealth but life... it is short, but it is the sweetest joy on this planet. and one should enjoy that!! I am an extrovert outgoing, honest, sincere, sharing and caring, warm person... 

Life must be given meaning by relating to others - helping others, being helped by others, giving and taking knowledge, sympathy, fun.. all the things that make our existence worthwhile. 
I am into Hospitality Industry, Love nature, travelling, meeting different kinds of people.","Warm??!! hot??!! Sincere,Honest,Caring...One who can share my ups n downs of Life,..And that is LIfe!!

"Presently working as ASST. GENERAL MANAGER (MM); i.e.middle Management level, in a Steel Sector company, a Central Govt PSU. I am working in this organization for over 25yrs by now and drawing monthly salary above Rs 49000/- per month (gross) +perks. My job is non-transferable type and I live in the integrated company township well equipped with all facilities required for a decent living.

I am Hindu/Jat (Age: 48 yrs), looks much younger &amp; energetic, with family roots in Delhi &amp; Haryana (Gothra self - sangwan &amp; motherA?s -malik). I am smart, handsome with medium built &amp; fair complexion. I am a simple living person, vegetarian, non-smoker, and teetotaler with no vice of any kind and fully devoted to the family and its welfare. I am practical, karmyogi, and down to earth person. I have enjoyed 16 yrs of marital life with no history of any family discord and blessed with two children (daughter 14 yrs &amp; son 9 yrs). However, divorce that was sought by her  has been granted by Supreme Court of India in AugA?06 and case for custody of minor children presently with her and under contest, is going on in High court. I continue to lead a happy and peaceful life with the present settled job in this beautiful port city of Visakhapatnam and fully committed towards my duty and responsibility towards my children in all possible ways till they become independent and embark on some career.

I was born &amp; all along brought-up in Delhi where my parents resided for nearly 45 years. My both sisters are married and settled abroad for over 20 yrs, i.e, in Riyadh (Saudi Arabia) &amp; Seoul (S.Korea). My both brother-in-laws are doctors and settled well in good positions in the above countries.  My only brother, elder to me, works for Delhi State Govt. and resides in New Delhi-110001 for over 25 years with his family. My Father who died 6 yrs back was an officer and retired from central govt. job and my mother is simple house-wife. She keeps visiting me but mostly stays at Delhi especially when my sisters visit India from abroad.

I thus seek, a matrimonial alliance from educated -- unmarried/widow /divorcee lady of age group 35-43yrs without any issues or physical handicap belonging to good &amp; respected Hindu North Indian family.  To be frank, I am interested in an alliance partner who will prefer to lead a peaceful homely life with me in full dignity &amp; honour. If someone harbors any special personal objectives or career goals in life at this middle age (except interest in a teaching job locally), it may not be possible in my place of job/stay. Interested families, to proceed further may contact while furnishing correct &amp; complete details from their side also on lines similar to above.","I thus seek, a matrimonial alliance from educated -- unmarried/widow /divorcee lady of age group 35-43yrs without any issues or physical handicap belonging to good &amp; respected Hindu North Indian family.

I am a very understanding person. I look 40. I will look after my  wife like a princess assuming she would look at my daughter as her own. My daughter is an adorable girl and I want to have a lot of fun with my new wife and daughter. Presently I am into my business and will definitely retire with lots of money and I expect my future wife to be a part of my growth. I prefer a woman without issues.

"I was born in Bangalore &amp; brought up &amp; educated in Mumbai. Very fair, tall, handsome &amp; looking much younger. I am simple &amp; straight-forward in nature; sincere towards everything in life &amp; hardworking person with a religious bent of mind, valuing customs &amp; traditions, but with a modern, practical outlook. I am staying seperately &amp; alone due to nuclear-family compulsions. On advice of friends &amp; relatives, I started to search for a suitable life-partner now only afresh. Well qualified, served a nationalised &amp; international bank for 25 years; 10 years as an OFFICER, before opting for VRS, now satisfactorily employed in the private sector. I possess own flat in Mumbai &amp; another one in its distant suburbs. 

Basically we are South Indian Brahmins hailing originally from Thanjavur. Since there is no seperate language categorization for my mother tongue while registering the profile, I wanted to mention mother tongue in this manner: ' Kannada / Tamil.' I have entered Kannada as my mother tongue since only one language can be mentioned; but some language has to be mentioned. I could have equally entered Tamil too as my mother tongue. There is no arrangement to mention both Kannada &amp; Tamil as my mother tongue. We factually speak Thanjavur Marathi at home, which is different from the usual Marathi spoken in Maharashtra. But having been brought up in Mumbai since birth, I have studied the regional language Marathi &amp; know to read &amp; speak. Thanjavur Marathi is a mixture of Sanskrit, Old Marathi, Kannada &amp; Tamil words. Hence I know both the languages Kannada &amp; Tamil &amp; can understand little Malayalam &amp; Telugu as well. People from our community are miniscule in number. It is common in our community to make matrimonial alliances with Kannada &amp; Tamil (Iyer / Iyengar) speaking Brahmins, &amp; Kannada / Tamil (Iyer / Iyengar) speaking Brahmins also do not hesitate to give their sons or daughters in marriage with our community, so much so that some of our relatives are speaking Kannada / Tamil at home as their mother tongue because we share a common religion, culture, tradition, customs &amp; practices as South Indian Brahmins with regard to celebration of festivals or conducting thread ceremony or marriage ceremony etc.
 
My hobbies include reading books, magazines &amp; newspapers, listening to Carnatic Classical Vocal as well as Carnatic music &amp; also other kinds of songs and music in different regional languages including Hindi, English, learning languages, visiting places of tourist &amp; religious interest, yoga, pranayama &amp; meditation etc. I have completed several Yoga &amp; Pranayama Courses. I love small chidren, nature, flora &amp; fauna. I am also a Shri Krishna [Gaudia Mutt &amp; ISKCON], Swamy Ayyappan, Shirdi Sai Baba, Satya Sai Baba &amp; Avadhoot Baba Shivanand devotee, presently attending their respective satsangs, but willing to change as per circumstances after marriage. I have also done The Art Of Living Course &amp; attending Veda &amp; Swami Chinmayananda Study Group Vedanta Classes in spare time. As judged by others, I am a person of clean habits, having no vices &amp; encumbrances at all.
 
In short, Responsible, Respectful, Caring &amp; Sharing, Loving, Family oriented person. Love to travel. Hailing from a good family background. I only aspire for mutual love, affection, caring &amp; to settle down once again with peace &amp; happiness in life.
 
Thank you very much for your kind interest &amp; enormous patience in reading this profile till the end &amp; best wishes to you for finding a suitable life-partner.","A life-partner should be any BRAHMIN, sub-caste no bar &amp; should profess pure vegetarianism. Unmarried profiles are most welcome. Widow &amp; Divorcee profiles without children &amp; with children upto three years of age also equally welcome. ","My family consists of only younger brother, who is employed in a nationalized bank &amp; his family who are decently settled separately. I have no sisters. My parents have expired. I am staying all alone in my father's own house.

"My nature is that of a simple and decent person who is understanding and has experience of life. I am a very dedicated person and very sincere about my work. Professionally I am a superintending Engineer in ONGC (Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited, a Maharatna PSU). My work has brought a lot of success in my life and has also helped me in growing as a good person. My schooling was pretty smooth and I used to be a topper in my class. After completing my school, I did B.Tech (Petroleum) from ISM University, Dhanbad. Subsequently after joining ONGC, I did M.Tech (Petroleum) as well. I have deep interest in investing money in quality shares &amp; pursue it as a hobby for wealth creation.  At present, I stay alone in my 2 BHK flat at Panvel (Navi Mumbai), in a complex having club house &amp; swimming pool and preferably would like my wife to join me here. In my life I have very few people close to me and I admire them the most. When I get time apart from my work, I like to watch movies with friends, travel to new places, listen to music, practise Yoga, Pranayama, meditation &amp; jogging.","I am looking out for a very fair and fair, slim, beautiful &amp; educated (preferably Graduate in any discipline), talented, vegetarian girl who has flair for quality life. Caste no bar. She should be a mature girl who has a practical way of looking at life and other aspects. In addition to this, she must come from a decent family background. She should be soft spoken and kindhearted in nature. My life partner can work if she wants to because this will help her in building confidence and an identity of her own in the society. I would expect my wife to be mature enough to respect elders. In return she will receive immense love and respect. I know that there are a lot of responsibilities of home and I will help my wife in completing the tasks at home as well as outside home. She will receive complete support and assistance from my side. If she is like the one I desire, then I assure her a happy future ahead. ","My mother is no more and father has taken retirement from his profession. He stays in Bihar at our native place. I have two lovely and understanding children. My daughter has completed MBBS and has joined PGD in clinical pathology in Govt. medical college Solapur (Maharashtra) &amp; is getting stipend (Rs 28000 pm). My son is presently pursuing Integrated MBA with B Tech in Information Tech from IIITM, Gwalior and has offer from MNC (to join at Bangalore by May 21, 2012).

"We are a Nuclear family consisting of Father and 4 children. Father and Mother no more; We are 2 Girls and 2 Boys. The elder two being my sisters followed by myself and the younger brother. My Eldest sister is married with 2 daughters. Her Husband was the Global Head of Marketing and Sales of one of the leading Groups based in the UAE. My second sister also married with 2 Children and based at Hyderabad. Her husband is in the Indian Army and worked as Colonel.(Retered). Next is me. I am based at Bangalore. The youngest is my brother who is also in the Indian Army and a Colonel, married and have 2 children based in Bangalore. In short ours is a sweet well settled family with no encumbrances save that I have to settle myself. I am looking forward to a simple natured fair charming lady who could be a part of this family and who can give and expect to get a lot of Love and affection from all and most importantly from me who will always be there at all times.","The ideal person who I feel would be a good match would be someone who is simple,loving and caring nature who can selflessly love and expect the same from her partner. dedicated and willing to understand and share responsibilities and be truly accomodative all of which she would get from me as her husband and ofcourse the respect and regards she gives elders would definetely earn her the blessings and affection from one and all in the family.
I would prefer someone with the above backgound with no family encumberances, her marital status may be divorced and single. A bit of home and kitchen related skills will be ideal as she can sure expect some contributions from me !!! 

I would now look forward to that fair, slim and charming lady who wants to be loved and willing to love whole heartedly for all times to come.

"I am an independent person with a strong interest in languages, literature, experimental movies, music of all sorts( Classical to some country). I am not a templegoer but deeply spiritual and find spiritual and useful messages in all religious thoughts. I read Gita and Bible with equal reverance. Anthropology and science fascinates me and art moves my soul. I like to write and read. Mostly fiction and philosophical treaties. I am a conversationalist with passion to listen a good discourse on just about any subject. Outdoors is my life. I do not visit Malls and shopping center for pleasure.  like challenges in life and I will seek them as long as I can perform. I manage three companies as a CEO and that is not so much important as the other things I wrote here. Research in human endeavors such as literature, arts and science is my primary interest. I like nature therefore being in garden admiring flowers, plants and dipping in flowing brooks are my favorite things. I love western dancing and enjoy Indian Classical dances and music immensely. I like sipping wine while reading poetry and go for trekking in the mountains of Colorado or Mesa in the New Mexico desert when I can. I am not a Hollywood/Bollywood fan and watch selective experimental movies; mainly non-American international low budget movies. I enjoy watching Sports (Cricket and American Football). I like cooking and experiment with foods. My favorite eating-places are Japanese Sushi Bars, Ethiopian, French and Vietnamese. I have profound respect for compassionate and kind people. Lastly, I wish to remember Landor's stanza when I am on the verge of leaving this world: "" I strove with none, None was worth my strife. I loved nature; next to nature Art. I warmed my both hands on fire of life. It sinks and I am ready to depart.""","I seek only companionship of that special one who will enlighten me, cherish my being and allow me to discover her so to know her and love her as if we both are just stepping out of our youth. Education and self sufficiency is important because I will want to have relationship which Gibran described as AA?A?two shores of an ocean where the oceanic waves of love and delightful coexistence will connect us, wash us and enrich us with one grain of sand given or taken away from us.AA?A?  Looks are important but the news media defined beauty is not. Looks reflect beauty of inner thoughts; those spring up without reasons and purpose when one is alone and contemplative like WordsworthAA?A?s Daffodils. Healthy and willing to go trekking with me in the beautiful mountains and bicycling through the forest trails will add romance to our lives, which is beyond the imagination of any bedroom lover. I am all yours if this fits into your needs. I ideal partner must be an organized person, matured by life experiences, she should be a professional open for enrichment through knowledge and ideals. I am not looking for a slave in the kitchen or in bedroom. Her love for me should be grown by discovering  my personality and qualities not by compulssion or obligations. I seek a compassionate soul, with a positve attitude, an advisor and a friend. There are no children to raise so she must look at life as the Almighties blessings for enjoying the good things this life offers.

"This is Gautam from Assam famous for its one horned Rhinos and Assam tea . I am intelligent, simple, loving, caring, sensitive, emotional, have a good sense of humor, God fearing and posses pleasing personality. I like to go for long drives and enjoy listening to good music. Cooking and gardening are my hobies. I play tennis and badminton . I also like to go for fishing. I also like to read books. I enjoy dancing and partying. Presently I am separated and have one son who is not living with me. Would describe myself as confident, calm, friendly, caring, honest, reliable, genuine, cheeky, playful . I have a great sense of humour and am looking for same in a partner. I am also emotionally and financially secure.
I believe in chemistry. Either two people meet and feel a connection or they don't. Two perfectly nice, attractive people may not necessarily be attracted to each other. If there is no chemistry you cannot force it to be there. I am a loving, kind, and generous person. I believe that two people in a relationship are each, at least partially, responsible for the other's happiness. I say what I mean and mean what I say. I don't make promises I do not intend to keep. I don't believe in mind games or power struggles or manipulation or control. These things are toxic to a relationships. I want someone who will be my best friend, and I will be her. Someone to laugh and be silly with and who will be there for me, as I would for her, if I cry. Someone who will genuinely care about my well being and does not always put her own needs and concerns first.

"I was born in Bangalore, in the year 1962. In the year 1964-65 my family shifted to Delhi and since than we have been staying here. I am sensitive, shy, sincere, straightforward and hardworking person. Very found of Music. I have learnt Hindustani Classical Music till Madhyama II year (Hawain Guitar) from Gandharva Mahavidhyala, Delhi and capable of playing various kinds of musical Instruments. I take private Tutions for Guitar, Keyboard etc. I am also associated with an Orchestra group. Academically I could not excel much on account of certain unavoidable situations and circumstances, which prevailed in the family due to various factors and reasons. (Details will telll you later). Unfortunately during such juncture, it was only my studies that were mostly affected, in comparison to my siblings; as such the impact of the losses &amp; damages caused with respect to my studies initially, continued and affected in my further education as well. Thus, I could not pursue my studies after matriculation. Moreover due to existence of economical uncertainty in the family because of father being jobless, I along with other siblings had to take up different jobs at an early and had to support the family to minimize the financial crisis that had been prevailing during those difficult and unforgettable days. Thereafter gradually things got improved &amp; stabilized and one after the other all my brother and sisters got married except myself. Currently I am working as Asstt. Administrative Officer in a Private Limited company and I am associated with this company since last 22 years. 

Taking into consideration my childhood memories, experience and my family's sufferings etc. initially I was determined never to get married. Now with the passage of time, recently I have experienced isolaltion &amp; loneliness, finding nobody with whom I could share my sorrows and grievances. Thus, I am now in search for a suitable partner/companion with whom I wish to spend rest of the life peacefully &amp; happily. Although my destiny did not allow me to do well academically, however it is my sincere wish and dream that at least my spouse to be well qualified and preferably working and self-dependent.

My famaily consists of father who is a freedom fighter, scholar, a man of high principles, honest and straiaghtforward person. He had spent and devoted most of his time on social and other similar activities rather then giving priority and first preference to discharge his duties &amp; responsibilities towards his own family. Mother is a housewife and she is the backbone of our family. Both are staying with me. Elder brother is associated with Delhi Science Form, his spouse is a Proffessor &amp; head of History department in a reputed College in Delhi University (North campus) and both are staying in their staff quarters in University campus. Out of three sisters elder one is settled in Bangalore working in Indian Airlines. Second one married to a French and settled in France, she was working as Air Hostess with Royal Jordanian Airlines. Youngest one very loving and affectionate is also settled in Delhi. If interested and ready to accept me as I am irrespective of my qualification and mere source of income, may contact me for further details. With best wishes.","To be honest,sincere,affectionate,loving,adjustable,coopeative, straightforward. She should be working.","Father is a Freedom Fighter now retired. Mother is a House Wife. Brother is associated with Delhi Science Form. His wife is Head of department (History) Miranda College, Delhi University.

"I am sincere, always think positive. My life style is simple. I am a Central Govt. Employee. I am a divorced person. Traveling, gardening my hobby. Exercise, yoga asana, meditation keep me strong and healthy. Purity, determination, devotion to duty and spirituality are the four pillar of my life.

I believe in true love, I believe in a higher Power, I believe in happily ever after. When we live together, it should connect all our mental and spiritual vibrations of both of us. As every one of us knows, life is sweet and is meant to be enjoyed to the fullest.

I love to engage myself in various activities and get peace in the work that I do and in that work where I am clear to my conscience. I get happiness by loving everybody, helping the needy, listening to music, reading or writing. I love the social gathering but prefer Solitude sometimes. 

To me marriage is something that bonds two souls and two families in one string. I want a strong friendly relationship between these two souls that will be based on mutual trust, respect, adjustment, commitment.",,Mother and Father no more.

"I would describe myself as a kind, generous, easy-going person. I love to laugh and enjoy funny situations. I enjoy traveling and the adventures of the outdoors. Getting away is important because I think everyone should see what else is out there. I also like going to the movies, theatre, concerts, museums or a nice restaurant. But I am just as happy staying home and hanging out friends and family. I would like to meet someone who has similar interests, but who can introduce different activities into my life.
My ideal match would be someone who is kind and considerate, generous and thoughtful, easy-going and funny. Someone who is not chained to their job, their computer or cell phone would be a plus. Nothing wrong with being a go-getter, but there has to be a good balance, don't you think? Someone who is mature, responsible and intelligent. Someone who puts butterflies in my stomach. Someone who effortlessly makes me laugh. Someone who isn't afraid to make a decision if needed. It would be nice to find a relationship where each person's personality and attitude compliments the other. I also think building upon a relationship first is the way to go.

"Marriage happens only once. That is what I personally believe in. When both the players have deep respect for the marriage institute, play the game with fare intention; solemnly follow set of rules without looking beyond each other. When you learn to live harmoniously with your better half, you grow, mingle and dissolve together evolving into a homogeneous entity forming a perfect concoction  called AA?A?soulmatesAA?A?. My late wife was a charismatic, beautiful, sensible and an intelligent lady whom I searched in the crowd after a great toil. But a personal tragedy took her away in the prime of her life.
Life has to go on and it is only one life you are endowed with of which you are conscious of. The concept of HOME is incomplete without a woman and I believe that a woman is an axis around which the entire house revolves and the lives of its occupants are woven. 

On a positive note, a second chance make you more sensitive towards life and one really learns that all those small and seemingly insignificant moments of life which passed unnoticed/overlooked were of tremendous importance when one pauses, stands and stares and absorbs them with a lovely smile. Your whole perspective of life gets a complete overhaul. 

Relationships are always to be worked out and need time to mature.

Self Assessment:

Describing me myself is not that important. When it comes to describe oneself it is a tremendous task. One can choose so many catchy adjectives for self description. But all the words are likely to loose their meaning and sheen when you view them with your own perspective. How can I be self judgmental?

I am a typical Scorpio and thanks to Linda GoodmanAA?A?s Star Signs for elaborately describing my personal traits and deep routed secrets. A straight-forward and forthright person, I am physically pleasant, mentally strong, emotionally delicate (idiot) and spiritually evolved. 

I have a romantic passion for everything that I undertake. Deeply interested in all Fine Art fields. I occasionally write poems and delve in paintings. Music uplifts my soul and gives fluidity to my emotions.

I like reading literature; preferably Classics. That is a gift my wife gave to me. Thomas Hardy is my favorite.

I love photography and am an ardent reader of Indian history which inspires me for embarking upon journeys to off track places. 

I am deeply in love with the Himalayas and perfectly tuned with nature. Cooking is a sort of meditation for me. Keeping my home spick &amp; span is my pastime.

My energy level being high, I always keep myself indulged in some or the other creative activity and can not sit still.

I have passion for rain and canAA?A?t resist the temptation of walking in rain. I feel like melting in rain.
I have been practicing Yoga for the past 30 years. I love to go for trekking and undertake walks for miles.

I have no any ambition; I am not in race for money and am fully contended. I am thankful to the God for whatever He has given to me. I am not a kind of person who keeps on going to temples for fulfillment of his desires since I have almost none. I donAA?A?t follow any set path of praying or indulging in any sort of rituals. I am like a bird set to fly in infinite space.","I donA?t want a Companion for cooking food and doing other household errands for me. We are skillful in home management. I believe in complete liberation of a woman and freedom of choices in every sphere of life. I understand that each individual need space to grow and blossom and has his on individual self that need not to be encroached upon by any other member. 

 I want a companion who can walk in rain and chase butterflies with me. Listen music with me and can sit silently for hours A? Nadi Ke KinareA? watching sunset and sharing silence.I understand that any normal woman more or less follows the convention. Marring a dream man;raising kids; having her own family unit and her own independent house. Almost half of the life is spent in buying/having our own house. Rearing and raising a child consume much of yours youthful years. By the time your child passes out school, 18 years are gone at the cost of prime years of your life. When we are past 45 we actually come to face with our life and ready to lead and enjoy it with our companion. Does age difference at this stage really matter? 
         
                                                Past is beyond recovery, Future you are never sure of. Even married to a person 3 to 5 years older does not guaranty life long relationship? Life is unpredictable. My hail and healthy wife left me at the age of 43 years all of a sudden completely unexpected. And who knows? Who is going to live longer?

"Life is great, a beautiful gift of God. I like to live every moment of my life to the fullest. I am self-motivated, confident, easy going but disciplined man. 
Like to go to Gym regularly and yoga is one of my favorites. So you get the taste of my likings.
I like to read, especially self improving books coz knowledge is an unlimited thing. 
I have great respect for elders. I try to live a balance life between spiritualism and materialistic world. More or less i am happy person and am looking my life partner who can complete my life and i can do hers.
I believe everyone is great and beautiful if we see them with open mind and don't let our Ego come in between. People like each others because they are different. Guess if everybody is similar to you and me then the world will be monotonous and boring.
So when two different open minded people get together  to share the journey of their lives with the Similar Goals to achieve, they do wonderful things and create a beautiful life.
I invite you to share your ideas, may be we are made for each other. Goodluck in your search as well.","I like an open minded person and am afraid of Snobs.
Seeking for God loving and a balanced, good head on her shoulder woman. The one who respects family values and elders. She should be health conscious and willing to learn and try new things in life with a good self-esteem and confidence. It's not too much to ask.

I am looking for a person who is a good communicator and has a pleasing personality. The ability to have an intelligent conversation is important because it is the starting point for two people to be comfortable and compatible with each other.

         i love to live in peaceful and harmonious environment and always follow a healthful diet.To her delight i have learnt massage which she will relish immensly.
     i am diplomatic and tactful,can sort out intriguing situations with patience and perseverance.Some times,however i feel frustrated because i have a very high expection of myself.i would love her to remind me of my realities and have me grounded.
        i love freedom to a great extent and this may be the bone contention between a relationship.Sometimes my  soul-mate may not take it easy and may feel neglected.But i must assure her that this freedom is not for waywardness,it is for acieving higher things in life not necessarily money and power.Freedomis priceless to me in the sense it the nucleus aroud which my life revolves.
     i am unusually adaptable.i love the texture,colour and taste of life.i want to taste everything at least once i life.

         i would like her to possess uncommonly sound common sense,gifted with the ability to see the beauty and potential in a given idea.i love her to be a steady partener,to give sound advice and consistent emotional support as she does not suffer from flights of fancy and naturally resists the emotional heights. She would be unconventional in thought and action but tend to be traditional in appearance,without  airs and pretensions.
       She would possess great compassion nd always seek to be of serviceto others,have concern for the weak and the downtrodden.She would maintain harmony within the family balancing and fusing divergent forces.

independent thinking, spiritually inclined --not religious per say --having passes this level of learning  leading to the  spiritual awareness

i like ladies --not wo-men -- who have that flair ,and style that stands out --  world view--sophistication in other words.
