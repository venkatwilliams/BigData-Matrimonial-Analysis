"Please read my Favorite quote: ""Fame is a vapor, Popularity an accident, Riches take wings, those who cheer today will curse tomorrow, only one thing endures, Character. I am searching for my Best friend who would be my soul mate. I am raised with higher moral values. Life without emotions is all abstract there is nothing concrete. I am an extrovert, positive minded person, an honest and forward thinking personality. I am creative, love to decorate and embellish my surroundings. I like beautiful views like flower bedded gardens, lakes, oceans, beaches and swimming pools. My sports are swimming and golf
My interests are cooking different cuisines with red wine,barbeque,long walks in the garden or on beach, writing poems &amp; creative writing, music and dancing, exploring new places, traveling, cruising. I like vibrant colors, something pleasing to the senses-but at the same time I am profoundly spiritual. I like to explore more and more about spirituality and ethics. My PhD thesis was also on the moral vision of a novelist. I always do up my house little different from others. I like to paint, sketch, make lovely flower arrangements and create something out of nothing.I was well settled in my career in India. I opted to move to this country after my shattered relationship. I was married. Sometimes god puts you in an awkward situation-probably to test your trust in the almighty power or to watch the strength of your body, mind and spirit. I got my Green card and now working on other aspects. Looking for a right partner with whom I can have fun. But also a committed person so that we stand by each other in good as well as bad times.

"A cultured, warm hearted, professional, sikh female. Easy on the eyes, and a good mix of style and substance. 
Likes:
 appreciate integrity, those who form own opinions and ideas. 
Progressive thinkers and those wear a beautiful smile and have a positive outlook on life.
 Simple, straight forward people who can easily talk about anything and everything
Green Open spaces. People who look after themselves physically  

Me: Am artistic, creative and stylish. Caring, well balanced, sporty and lead an active lifestyle. Interests include pottering around bookshops, keeping fit, city breaks but not done too much travelling this year. Love tropical plants and Far Eastern Art eg Japanese, cookery and hanging out with my friends and family. 
 
Am here because I am hoping to meet someone who is from a progressive urban family like myself. I am a caring person and would want the same in return. Not here to play games with someone and dont want others playing games with my heart either. I know there are people out here for that, so please excuse if you have different intents from mine and good luck. 

I dont have a picture of the person I want to meet in mind and am not interested in his worldly wealth nor past. He simply has to have a generous attitude and loving heart. Thats it! 
Oh yes, although I am educated in the UK and love the great outdoors and keeping fit and travelling, it doesnt make me less Indian. 

I had a brief issueless marriage. It ended before it began and was very brief. I am seeking someone who is serious about the commitment and ready to work for it, given that nothing is magic. I am definitely in it for the long haul and realise that it takes time and effort to make anything work. 
 
You: you are a n/s and what works is someone between 40-47( issueless), as this is the same age bracket, a professional but it doesnt matter what you do just so long as you enjoy it. You have to have a kind genuine, honest heart and be broad minded and humble! YOu dont have to have extraordinary pastimes, such as parachuting every other day:-) just a regular man... yes, really! A great smile and the ability to make someone laugh would be great!
 YOu would be down to earth, son of the soil, mature headed, warm and mild mannered. 

He would be very lucky as my family tells me I have a lot to offer the right man. 

 If English is not your first language then I am definintely not the one for you and wish you luck.  
I am willing to relocate for the right person, be it India, US or in UK anywhere 
Time wasters please excuse.  
Thanks for reading.","The man I seek would be 41-48(close to my age bracket/generation!) and hindu/sikh based anywhere. If English is not your primary language, then i am definitely not the one for you but i wish you luck!He'd be the type who one could depend on and is reliable!!! Non-negotiable! He'd come from a happy family with a normal upbringing. Oh yes, i am happy to consider relocation for the right person be it India, UK, US etc
I am reluctant to put my picture on the site so pls dont ask for one unless you have one here thats visible. I never thought I'd be looking out here, but who knows. Nothing ventured, nothing gained! If you have depth and are looking for someone who could be a good partner, then hooray, might be onto something! 

Persons with emotional baggage, those who've got kids(either with them or ex-partner) pls excuse.
