"Bismillah, Asalaamu Alaikum, Alliance is being sought for my youngest daughter Mariyam. Born in Mysore, Karnataka, India and brought up in Saudi, Canada. Family immigrated to Canada in 1995 and returned to Mysore in 2001 with a view to complete kids education in India after having obtained Canadian Passports. Currently on OCI (akin to dual Citizenship) Cards in India, so we now travel on Canadian Passports only. Mariyam completed her Dentistry and internship (BDS) degree in 2011 India and thereafter specialized herself in Hospital Management with a post-graduate degree (MBA HCS) in Nov 2012, both degrees from India. Father being a retd engineer who worked in Middle East and Canada, family currently dependent on some modest rental income for sustenance. Mother, a house maker. Elder sister is MBA in Finance, married to a doctor (MD) from Bangalore and settled in UK. Elder brother to Mariyam has double masters in Computer Science. We are a small nuclear family of practicing Muslims, strictly against all forms of dowries and demands both paying and receiving. As us originally being from Karnataka, we would greatly appreciate groom's ancestral origins to be preferably either from Karnataka or Indian Hyderabad for obvious similarity reasons of cultural brought up, language, dialects, food habits, dress codes, traditions, etc. No offense intended. We regularly perform 5-times salat, fasting, annual zakat, tilawat etc. Other than when in a Muslim country, Mariyam did not wear nor does she wears now in India, any Burqas or Hijab but sticks to Asian costumes when in India - for obvious reasons.

I am vegetarian and trying very, very hard to stick to that for the last few years. As for appearance wise, I am not a beauty queen by any means but I like to try and look as nice as possible and daily wear salwar kameez and sarees along with some western clothes occasionally. I go to the Gurdwara as often as I can, it is where I feel most at peace. I have a few mentors who are helping me along my way, but I am hoping that my husband will become my biggest teacher. Now as far as hobbies or things I love movies, biggest Bollywood fan and foreign films in general are pretty good, but I am definitely into sappy girly love stories. I'm a total hopeless romantic. But I also love action and Comedy films and love documentaries and independent films as well. I don't think there has ever been a time when I have gotten into my car and not had some kind of music playing, I love all types of music as long as there is a creative passion behind it, even if it is kind of nonsense I feel like someone put a lot of effort into making it and I respect it even if I don't care for it. I, myself am learning to play Sitar and Harmonium, and one day would love to add Dilruba to that list! So I am very much into classical Indian music and old Bollywood songs. I also draw and paint, lately I have been really trying to give myself extra time to do it along with my passion for photography as well. I also like to sew quilts and crochet from time to time too.

Hail from a reputed Syed family. Parents are well settled in Saudi Arabia.,"We are looking for a family which has a good blend of high religious values and modernity. A family that has good lineage to go with good upbringing of children. We are looking for a family that is rich in outlook and attitude. From such a family we seek a young man who is grounded in reality. One who seeks a partner who completes the family.
One who knows that ultimately it is the aakhira that scores over the dunya. One who has principles and values and abides by them. He may be reasonable to look at but outstanding in seerat. He should be flexible and warm. Well qualified for this opens the mind and allows for future growth.
Honesty and integrity is a must. Since Zainab is just 22, we prefer to have a small age difference. Overall persona should be dynamic, go getter, impressive yet humble.
