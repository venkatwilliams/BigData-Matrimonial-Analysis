"I am keen to start the second phase of my life, and am in search of the right woman to share my life with and form a true partnership, you know the kind of bond that makes people green. ideally, you will be pretty, lot of fun, educate and working, and someone who truly enjoys living a full and adventurous life. Professionally, I believe I have done reasonably well in my job. I believe I am a leveled-headed guy, hardworking, well educated, and very clean individual who enjoys having fun, the good things life has to offer, and making a woman happy. I also think I have a huge heart and I am a very affectionate and passionate person with a great sense of humor. I'm pretty transparent and communicate well and often, and will say what I mean, and mean what I say. What I think you will be: Feminine, classy, confident, uninhibited, playful, smart, beautiful, fit, sweet and decisive and yet God fearing (open to any religion etc!). You will love to dress up, but are not afraid to break a nail. I guess you are also in good shape and have the self-discipline and motivation it takes to stay that way. And, to top it all, I am sure you will be a typical Lady. Giving, warm, affectionate, romantic, loyal, emotional, fashionable, loves to kiss and be held. I am the type of guy who is looking to settle down but with all the fun/spontaneity of a relationship. Like, I would love Sunday mornings in bed together reading the newspaper, enjoying a cup of coffee, and cuddling, knowing that someone is always there for you; thinking about that other person as you get through your work day, knowing that you're coming home to them, Testing them when the workday gets especially boring.
