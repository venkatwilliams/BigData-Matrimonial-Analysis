"I describe myself as a simple person with a friendly nature who mingles with people very easily. I have a very sporting nature and am always ready to accept challenges. Further, I value the importance of elders in my life and give them the top place in my life. My work is my god and I do it with full devotion. I never keep my work on hold for the next day. Professionally, I am working as a Head of Operations in Zee TV. I am very happy with my profession and want to grow in the same field. I have a very loving family. My mother is a homemaker and father is a retired gazetted officer and currently in the business. Further, I have a sister who is married and well settled in her life. I was a good student and a good performer of my class. After my school education I did B Com from Bangalore and Diploma in Multimedia. The list of my friends is very short but I enjoy being with them and love their company. Further, my deep interest lies in capturing the beautiful pictures, listening to some great music of my choice and reading books. In addition to this, I play outdoor games like cricket.","My life partner will have the choice to decide whether she wants to work or not. I will give her full freedom and time to decide about her profession. She should be well qualified and must have a positive way of looking at life and judging people. 
She must be well settled in her life and my preference would go for a girl from South India. Further, she must have a good family background with a decent image in the society. 
I am ready to share the responsibilities at home so that even my wife feels that I am always there to help her. I would feel privileged to help her with the work at home as well as outside home. 
The traditions and culture followed in our family has always been our priority and I want my life partner to understand this and make sure that she respects the traditional values.

"I come from a decent, reasonably well-to-do, upper middle-class family. We are a compact family - only me and my parents - no siblings. Both myself and my parents are modern in our outlook, but at the same time we value our traditions and customs, since we believe that these traditions and customs are the ones which bring discipline in one's life and teach us to value everything that God gives us.
My first marriage was an unfortunate and bitter experience. We got divorced on mutual understanding after 11 years of separation; more about it later. 
I feel that one can emerge from any situation in life given the right attitude, patience, dedication and utmost faith in the Almighty.
Whatever I am today, financially, is entirely on my own, without any help from anybody. I am a self-made man and take pride in saying this to anybody. I am both an introvert and extrovert, serious and humorous, hard-working and playful, as the situation demands. Having Libra as my moon sign, striking a balance between extremities comes to me naturally.
My favourite pastime is watching a good movie/ drama, solving puzzles, reading or, simply spending some quality time with the family either indoors or outdoors. I am passionate about music - it doesnt matter which kind. The only criteria is that it should be soothing to the mind. I like playing cricket, tennis, badminton and chess. Being one with nature, with lush greenery and waterfall, or a calm sea-front, is my idea of a perfect getaway.","Mutual-respect, understanding, caring, empathy, supporting, giving each other his/her space, honesty, giving importance to family, and above all, commitment, is what I look forward to in marriage.

"Hi I am Rahul. I am a soft, honest , kind hearted and very emotional person but at times get angry too. My mother says that I am still childish. My friends and relatives love me due to my above nature. I love to help people in distress, it gives me immense peace and satisfaction. I believe in God and perform puja daily. I am a follower of Lord Shiva. I am very adventorous and love to enjoy nature and be in the forests. When ever I get time I get out for the villages or hills or forests in my car or bike. I am a music lover. I am an ardent follower of Late RD Burman and Kishore Kumar, specially the emotional and sentimental hits. I love gardening too and now preparing a farm house at my native village at Nadia (WB). I am a bit shy natured and get nervous in front of girls. I am very choosey about making friends, but once I befriend somebody it remains forever. I am a food lover also and my relatives are very fond of feeding me with good dishes. This is all about me, bye","Firstly she should have the belief that she would be acceptable by her in laws. I believe that first my partner should be mentally prepared for marriage, she can take her time in fully knowing about her life partner, only then she should agree for marriage. After marriage she should accept her in laws to be her own family members and not treat them as outsiders or aliens, now a days this has become a trend for newly married brides not to care for her in laws, she knows only her husband. This is not acceptable      at all. She should be expert in the household matters and be capable of looking into the education of the children. She will have to adjust with everybody as everybody would adjust with her. Her parents should not interfere or poke into her maried life once she is married. Nothing more is required for becoming an ideal wife.

"My philosophy for life is quite simple. I get up in the morning with a smile and go to sleep with a yawn. In between, I occupy myself as best as I can. Fill what's empty. Empty what's full. Scratch where it itches. Smile at all. Share what I have. Crack jokes to laugh. Make others happy. Spread love amongst all. And that's life what I call.
I am well organized, sincere, hard-working, polite, kind &amp; affectionate, passionate &amp; romantic, have good sense of humor, understanding and a good listener too. Love music &amp; movies, painting, arts &amp; crafts, decorating, photography, gardening, grilling &amp; cooking.
Love making new friends, get-together with family, relatives and friends, travelling distance places, exploring beaches &amp; nature, adventuring mountains &amp; forests.
Expect to live life to the fullest, enjoy an adequate happy enthusiastic life with my family, be a good husband and father, and expect my beloved to be simple, honest, faithful and straight forward and always smiling.
Seeking for my better half as she is out there, somewhere on this planet, know &amp; understand her better, share with her, marry and love her with all my heart, be honest &amp; faithful. Understand and respect her and live happily for the rest of my life.","According to me marriage is the union of two hearts to form one soul. Each one is the complementary to the other to make one whole.

"I am a caring person looking for someone who has a good head on her shoulders. She should be compassionate and yet be able to manage the finances in the interest of the family. In financial matters, I follow the principles of financial guideline put forth by Suze Orman. 

On religious note, although I am a converted muslim, I respect all religions and have friends that cut across religions. 

While growing up in India and watching my parents devote their life to raise us, I learnt a valuable lesson of life - that children are our future. They need nurturing, time, effort and caring for their upbringing to be successful. I try to follow these basics with my own child and his friends. No wonder some of his friends have declared me the coolest dad who likes to play with and motivate them. 

To know more about myself and my expectations of my spouse, I decided to put perfectmatch. com to test for their profile analysis. Here is the gist of my profile analysis by perfectmatch. 

""I am cautious at the beginnings of relationships not to fall in love too fast. However, my optimistic nature looks to the possible rather than to the difficulties that may lie ahead. I am likely to put my love at the center of my life and I need someone who wants to be there. I take time for love and I need someone with the same priority. However, I do like varied experiences, so my life needs growth, change and perhaps, adventure. Boredom and habit are a part of all long-term relationships. I need someone who, like myself, will need to keep life (and the relationship) stimulating and new. I am the universal connector. I get along with just about everyone, except perhaps a serious Introvert. I am flexible enough to meet the challenge! In any case, I have the tools to be a great partner: I am not insecure in relationships, I like to work with someone on creating a life together, I don't get upset easily and seek intimacy and open up my heart to a partner. ""

I grew up in India in an educated Hindu household where education was the religion of our daily life. After attending AMU, I converted to Islam and came to USA for my graduate work. I am blessed with a ten years old son who lives with me. My son has been my source of inspiration for the odds that he has overcome to become what he is now. Most of my family lives in Northern India. My family includes: a) a sister who is married and lives in New Delhi b) a single brother who works for a Financial company and my parents. My father is retired now and my mother is a homemaker. All of my family is very open-minded and respects people for their belief and tries to seek good in each one of us.","To know more about myself and my expectations of my spouse, I decided to put perfectmatch. com to test for their profile analysis.

In any case, I have the tools to be a great partner: I am not insecure in relationships, I like to work with someone on creating a life together, I don't get upset easily and seek intimacy and open up my heart to a partner.

"I am journalist in India's most respected English newspaper, in Delhi. My interests in journalism is in international relations, strategic matters, etc.. 
Intellectually inclined, I am very much into reading, having over 1,000 books on various non-fiction subjects. My book on real reasons of war in Iraq and Afghanistan is nearing completion. 
I think I am a calm, simple, hassle-free, practical and down-to-earth person. I am attracted towards personalities having solidity and substance. 
I am interested in heritage, culture, art films, experiencing nature/environment and giving taste to all cuisines and if time permits, going for jogging. 
My parents being very feminist, I and my brother have been inculcated very pro-feminist attitude. 
I like to befriend those having solidity and substance in their personality. I also admire those who are practical and have immense common-sense.
Have experienced the world more than a person of my age normally does, which has made me look older and be more matured than my age. 
I invite you to see me through your eyes, to let me know myself better, which will also help me in putting my profile in a more correct perspective. 
In his condolence message on death of JaipurAA?A?s last official maharaja, Queen ElizabethAA?A?s II husband Prince Philip, after describing the maharaja, stated, AA?A?I think this is a prejudiced view. But then being pally is prejudiceAA?A?. In spite of being absolutely honest in describing myself, whether you are okay with my (prejudiced?) description or not, as the QueenAA?A?s hubby was with his, depends on whether we are going to be more than friends, or remain strangers. The ball is in your court, maAA?A?am, and IAA?A?m waiting for your serve.","I want my life partner to be good by qualities of heart and head. Even if not very educated, she should have educated mindset. 
I believe in spouse being equal in all aspects of married life, sharing all responsibilities, be in household or otherwise. I respect a lady who's an amiable combo of the Occidental and the Oriental. 
How about the person who would partner my life have the qualities which I don't have, thus supplementing and complementing my personality? But similarities in basics should be there. 
Would you disagree if I want her to walk our life besides me, not behind me or ahead of me? I'll dislike if she doesn't freely expresses all her thoughts, emotions, etc. to me. 
From theory to practical - if this asking-for-too-much list is a mismatch, just getting along, will make the days of our lives. 
Are you the one, who with me, will become the two-together, through thick and thin, till death does us apart? If not, then don't keep someone more deserving than me, waiting.",,20 to 45,26 Mar 1968,11:03:00,India,Lucknow,Average,,,Rajput,Rajput,,,Whetish Medium ,,Self,B.A. (Arts),"45 yrs, 5ft 8in,<br />

Well, I've also done a certificate course in Marketing Management. Besides, I individually participated in several talk shows of All India Radio ( 'Akashvani' &amp; 'Yuvavani' ), reciting my self-composed poems as well as performed at several prestigious cultural programmes sharing stages with celebrities &amp; prominent intellectuals. Please note that I may also relocate to the bride's place if required but I'll be visiting my mother as frequently as possible, say once a month or at least every year.

"Sensitive and well-bred due to very loving and caring parents;who despite being highly educated and being ambitious, thought of their two sons more than anything else. I expect also to be a parent like them. As we are extremely well-off, dowry is a taboo, and considered an insult. Thus my life partner should be decent, well educated woman of empathetic and aesthetic nature. I wish to remain in All India Radio as Producer, but I shall continue my forays in to Bollywood, as training from FTII never goes to any waste. I wish to be a greater writer than my father, that shall be my way of paying respect to my folks. 
Incidentally I always wanted to be a pilot, doctor, broadcaster&writer; in that order while growing up!My parents did not let me join Naval Avionics!I myself left Maulana Azad Medical College, Delhi after one boring year!After graduation, I taught English Literature for a while and sat for my exams for All India Radio, got in and joined as a producer at an enviable(yet I always felt at an immature)age of 22. But something lacked in life, it kind of hit you while driving to FM transmission early in morning or driving back home at midnight!Since I was 5 or6 years of age, I had been mesmerised by my dad bent on his desk, writing!
I decided to go for film writing instead of literature and yet whether it was an indirect or direct wish, this was something which dawned upon me when I was 36. In order to fulfill that desire;I decided to sit for FTII's Screenplay course as a student, after putting in 13 years in All India Radio, Delhi as Programme Executive(PEX)/Producer. All India Radio, Delhi is one of the most action filled places one can wish for, as is broadcast journalism/programming, but I felt stiffled as I was considered an expert in non-fiction programmes on AIR FM and other channels. It was this that impelled me to again become a student at rather an advanced age, but liked and encouraged by my younger batchmates I topped the course &amp; was sent on deputation to FTII(The Film &Television; Institute of India, Pune)from AIR, Delhi as Associate professor&Officer; on Special Duty to director of FTII. 
My life partner must like literature, art, music, movies and have a distinct identity &amp; personality of her own. I hope to be a partner in her growth as an individual, and off course some one you will spend your rest of the life with. 
The most important thing that I've learnt watching my parents is committment. My mother was my father's strongest ally, critic and counselor all rolled into one, while he served as First Secretary(Education&Culture;)in Indian Highcommissions in Trinidad&Tobago; and later in Mauritius. Now that she's afflicted with immobility due to two strokes occurring simultaneously in 2001, my father tends to her all by himself, refusing to hire any personal nurse. 
Money is something that nobody in our family is unduly worried about, as both ancestral as well as self accquired is what would qualify us as extremely well off. However money is something you spend to live and not something you live for-I would expect my future partner to understand that.","slim,pretty and of a pleasant disposition.must be from a good family background.She will not have to worry about in-lawsproblem nor dowry.","My father, Dr. Hargulal Gupta, is a well known Indologist, novelist, critic, former diplomat and retired professor of Hindi;who taught for 43 years in D. U. My mother gave up her job as a Librarian in Sapru House to bring us(I &amp; my kid brother)up. My younger brother, Alok is B. Tech(computers)&MBA;, and is senior manager in Bechtel, Gurgaon. His Wife, Kavita is the Head of Dept. (Geography)in Sanskriti School, Chankyapuri. I have a beautiful Arian nephew, Kartikay, whose two years old. Ours is a joint family staying in our own bungalow i in Delhi university Teachers'colony-Vaishali, Pitampura.
